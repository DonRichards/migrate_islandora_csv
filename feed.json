            "content_html": "<p>The Portland Common Data Model (PCDM) is a flexible, extensible domain model that is intended to underlie a wide array of repository and DAMS applications. The primary objective of this model is to establish a framework that developers of tools (e.g., Samvera-based engines, such as Hyrax, Hyku, Sufia, and Avalon; Islandora; custom Fedora sites) can use for working with models in a general way, allowing adopters to easily use custom models with any tool. Given this interoperability goal, the initial work has been focused on structural metadata and access control, since these are the key actionable metadata.</p>\n<p>To encourage adoption, this model must support the most complex use cases, which include rich hierarchies of inter-related collections and works, but also elegantly support the simplest use cases, such as a single user-contributed file with a few fields of metadata. It must provide a compact interface that tool developers can easily implement, but also be extensible enough for adopters to customize to their local needs.</p>\n<p>As the community migrates to Fedora 4, much of our metadata is migrating to RDF. This model encourages linked data best practices, such as using URIs to identify all resources, using widely-used vocabularies where possible, and subclassing existing classes and properties when creating new terms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm\">Source Ontology</a></p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/duraspace/pcdm/images/coll-object-file.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"pcdm flowchart\" /></figure></p>\n<p>See a full breakdown at <a href=\"https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm/wiki#:~:text=The%20Portland%20Common%20Data%20Model,of%20repository%20and%20DAMS%20applications.\">duraspace/pcdm/wiki</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"namespaces\">Namespaces</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Prefix</th>\n<th align=\"center\">URI</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\">acl</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#\">http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">dc</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">dcterms</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\">http://purl.org/dc/terms/</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">pcdm</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://pcdm.org/models#\">http://pcdm.org/models#</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">foaf</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\">http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">gen</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2006/gen/ont#\">http://www.w3.org/2006/gen/ont#</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">iana</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/\">http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/</a> (see note)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">ldp</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#\">http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">ore</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/\">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">rdfs</td>\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\">http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"core-classes\">Core Classes</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm/wiki#pcdmobject\">pcdm:Object</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>An Object is an intellectual entity, sometimes called a “work”, “digital object”, etc. Objects have descriptive metadata, access metadata, may contain files and other Objects as member “parts” or “components”.

The Migrate module only provides the framework, it’s up to you to create the rules that take data from a source, through a process (i.e. a mapping) to a destination. A set of these rules is called a “migration”. It has to be set up (as a Configuration Entity, either by importing a YAML file or by installing a Feature) and then it has to be ran. In a nutshell the steps are the following</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a CSV file.</li>\n<li>Create a yml for each type of entity (person, place, event, university, etc) needing to mint. </li>\n<li>Create a “file” yml configuration file for the files.</li>\n<li>Create a “media” yml configuration file for the files to specify their media behavior once in Drupal.</li>\n<li>Create a “node” yml configuration file for gluing the file and media to a node. It the Islandora 7 terminology this would be the “object”.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/86034395-88738c00-ba08-11ea-8aaa-48bea9d0cc97.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Screenshot of Migrate UI\" /></figure></p>\n<p>Althought this process can be done in the admin UI, it’s highly suggested to use drush commands.

You’ll need to tune the following settings in your php.ini:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>upload_max_filesize – The maximum allowed upload file size.</li>\n<li>post_max_size – The maximum allowed POST data size.</li>\n<li>max_input_time – Maximum allowed input time.</li>\n<li>max_execution_time – The maximum allowed time the scripts are allowed to run.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, large file transfer over HTTP still has a host of issues once you properly configure your server. PHP’s integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit integers, some filesystem functions may return unexpected results for files which are larger than 2GB and could cause <code>filesize</code> to report the UI an incurrate reading. It won’t cause functions to fail just to not report correctly. This is a reported flaw within <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filesize.php\">PHP</a>. </p>\n",

The Drupal 8 module <em>permissions_by_term</em> and the sub-module <em>permissions_by_entity</em> allows us to create a ‘ETD-submission’ term that, when applied to nodes and media will restrict access to them (and files as an extension of media) to permission group members.</p>\n<p>However, access to files will only be checked if they are in a managed filesystem such as the Drupal private filesystem or one provided by a Flysystem adapter (like the Fedora Adapter provided by Islandora 8). When Islandora 8 creates derivate media it places them in the public filesystem by default. This is generally a good idea because it is more performant than other filesystems but then derivatives of restricted items become publicly accessible, which is not what we want. A repository manager can change the derivative actions to save them into either the private of Fedora filesystems, but this comes at a performance cost when accessing files that are publicly accessible.</p>\n<p>Enter <em>file_access_fix</em>. This handy module will check an entity (node, media, etc.) on update to see if it has any referenced files. If so, it will check if the entity is available by Anonymous users and will move the file to the appropriate filesystem, either public or private, based on it’s availability. So, if I create a derivative that is saved in the private filesystem by default, this module will check to see if the media is publicly accessible, if so, it will move it to the more performant public filesystem for me! If I ever decide that the media actually should be restricted, the module will move the file from the public filesystem back to the private one.

Mainly the content hosted on your website must consist primarily of scholarly articles - journal papers, conference papers, technical reports, or their drafts, dissertations, pre-prints, post-prints, or abstracts. Content such as news or magazine articles, book reviews, and editorials is not appropriate for Google Scholar. Content must make either the full text of the articles or their complete author-written abstracts freely available above the fold. There are several other restrictions that can be found at <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#overview\">Google Scholar Inclusion Guidelines</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"metatag-google-scholar\"><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag_google_scholar\">Metatag Google Scholar</a></h4>\n<p>Currently the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag_google_scholar\">Metatag Google Scholar</a> along with the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag\">metatag</a> modules adds the following <em>Highwire Press</em> tags:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>citation_title</li>\n<li>citation_author</li>\n<li>citation_publication_date</li>\n<li>citation_journal_title</li>\n<li>citation_issn</li>\n<li>citation_isbn</li>\n<li>citation_volume</li>\n<li>citation_issue</li>\n<li>citation_firstpage</li>\n<li>citation_lastpage</li>\n<li>citation_dissertation_institution</li>\n<li>citation_technical_report_institution</li>\n<li>citation_technical_report_number</li>\n<li>citation_pdf_url</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_title&quot; content=&quot;The testis isoform of the phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit (PhK-T) plays a critical role in regulation of glycogen mobilization in developing lung&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Liu, Li&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Rannels, Stephen R.&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Falconieri, Mary&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Phillips, Karen S.&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Wolpert, Ellen B.&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Weaver, Timothy E.&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_publication_date&quot; content=&quot;1996/05/17&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_journal_title&quot; content=&quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_volume&quot; content=&quot;271&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_issue&quot; content=&quot;20&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_firstpage&quot; content=&quot;11761&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_lastpage&quot; content=&quot;11766&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_pdf_url&quot; content=&quot;http://www.example.com/content/271/20/11761.full.pdf&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The title tag, e.g., citation_title or DC.title, must contain the title of the paper. Don’t use it for the title of the journal or a book in which the paper was published, or for the name of your repository. This tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>\n<p>The author tag, e.g., citation_author or DC.creator, must contain the authors (and only the actual authors) of the paper. Don’t use it for the author of the website or for contributors other than authors, e.g., thesis advisors. Author names can be listed either as “Smith, John” or as “John Smith”. Put each author name in a separate tag and omit all affiliations, degrees, certifications, etc., from this field. At least one author tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>\n<p>The publication date tag, e.g., citation_publication_date or DC.issued, must contain the date of publication, i.e., the date that would normally be cited in references to this paper from other papers. Don’t use it for the date of entry into the repository - that should go into citation_online_date instead. Provide full dates in the “2010/5/12” format if available; or a year alone otherwise. This tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>\n<p>For journal and conference papers, provide the remaining bibliographic citation data in the following tags: citation_journal_title or citation_conference_title, citation_issn, citation_isbn, citation_volume, citation_issue, citation_firstpage, and citation_lastpage. Dublin Core equivalents are DC.relation.ispartof for journal and conference titles and the non-standard tags DC.citation.volume, DC.citation.issue, DC.citation.spage (start page), and DC.citation.epage (end page) for the remaining fields. Regardless of the scheme chosen, these fields must contain sufficient information to identify a reference to this paper from another document, which is normally all of: (a) journal or conference name, (b) volume and issue numbers, if applicable, and (c) the number of the first page of the paper in the volume (or issue) in question.</p>\n<p>For theses, dissertations, and technical reports, provide the remaining bibliographic citation data in the following tags: citation_dissertation_institution, citation_technical_report_institution or DC.publisher for the name of the institution and citation_technical_report_number for the number of the technical report. As with journal and conference papers, you need to provide sufficient information to recognize a formal citation to this document from another article.</p>\n<p>For all document types, the guiding principle is to present your article as it would normally be cited in the “References” section of another paper. E.g., citations to technical reports normally include their assigned numbers, so the number of the report should be present in some appropriate field. Likewise, the name of the journal should be written as “Transactions on Magic Realism” or “Trans. Mag. Real.”, not as “Magic Realism, Transactions on” or “T12”. Omission or unusual presentation of key bibliographic fields can lead to mis-identification of your articles.</p>\n<p>All tag values are HTML attributes, so you must escape special characters appropriately. E.g., <meta name=\"citation_title\" content=\"&quot;Andar com meus sapatos&quot; - uma an&#225;lise cr&#237;tica\">. There’s no need to escape characters that are written directly in your webpage’s character encoding, such as Latin diacritics on a page in ISO-8859-1. However, you must still escape the quotes and the angle brackets.</p>\n<p>The “<meta>“ tags normally apply only to the exact page on which they’re provided. If this page shows only the abstract of the paper and you have the full text in a separate file, e.g., in the PDF format, please specify the locations of all full text versions using citation_pdf_url or DC.identifier tags. The content of the tag is the absolute URL of the PDF file; for security reasons, it must refer to a file in the same subdirectory as the HTML abstract.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sharing--metadata\">Sharing  Metadata</h3>\n<p>Please see OAI-PMH </p>\n<h3 id=\"embargos\">Embargos</h3>\n<p>A short demo of the major functionality of the Drupal 8 Embargoes module for the Islandora community, using the Islandora 8 Vagrant virtual machine and Repository Item type nodes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pUi8G8uxcU\" title=\"Embargoes demo for Islandora 8\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/5pUi8G8uxcU/0.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Embargoes demo for Islandora 8\" /></figure></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"tombstoning\">Tombstoning</h3>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/styles/grid-3-2x/public/project-images/death.png?itok=1ZNaahmf\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"tombstone logo\" /></figure><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/tombstones\">Tombstones</a> is a module that informs users who attempt to view deleted content that the resource has been removed instead of showing a generic 404 page.

What this means for a repository platform like Islandora at a general level is that image-based objects such as (still) images and paged content can be managed by Islandora but viewed in external applications, and that Islandora can bring in image-based content from elsewhere to supplement locally managed content. If this intrigues you, see the section “Looking under the hood (and beyond)” below.</p>\n<p>At a practial level, because Islandora supports several of the IIIF specifications, we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zoom, pan, and rotate images within OpenSeadragon</li>\n<li>Islandora uses an IIIF-compliant image server (by default, <a href=\"https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/\">Cantaloupe</a>) that utilizes the IIIF Image API. This capablity is similar to what Islandora 7.x users experience when they view a Large Image.</li>\n<li>Display thumbnails for all pages of a book or newspaper issue within image viewers</li>\n<li>IIIF-compliant image viewers such as OpenSeadragon or Mirador can display a “collection” of images such as all the pages of a book or newspaper issue using the <a href=\"https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/\">IIIF Presentation API</a>. For example, here is a screenshot of OpenSeadragon rendering all the pages of a book: <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/osd_collection_mode.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"pages of a book\" /></figure></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"using-iiif-in-islandora-8\">Using IIIF in Islandora 8</h3>\n<p>Implementation of the IIIF Presentation API is new in Islandora 8, and using it is as simple as configuring a Context (in fact, you don’t even need to configure it; the Context, Openseadragon Block, already exists by default). To use this Context, all that is required is for your book or newspaper (or other paged content) to be given a model of “Paged Content” or “Publication Issue”. Then, in the Openseadragon Block Context, make sure the term used in the “Node has term” condition (you can register more than one term there). Now, when you view a paged content Islandora object, you will see thumbnails of all of its child pages (assuming you have added some child pages to the object) in the OpenSeadragon viewer as illustrated above.</p>\n<p>To view an object’s <strong>manifest</strong> navigate to the node’s URL and add <code>/manifest</code></p>\n<p>Example: <code>http://myrepo.edu/node/23/manifest</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"bonus\">Bonus</h3>\n<p>IIIF-compliant viewers don’t need to be embedded in Islandora websites. If a viewer on another website knows the URL of a IIIF manifest like the ones that Islandora can produce, that viewer can display the content described in the manifest. Here’s an example of how a viewer can display from multiple external domains with just a manifest.\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85555851-4e634e00-b5f4-11ea-8bef-496bc6357385.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Mirador example with multiple sources\" /></figure></p>\n<p>For more information see Islandora’s documentation on <a href=\"https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/iiif/#using-iiif-in-islandora-8\">Using iiif in Islandora 8</a>.

Minting can be done either during a migration, during a batch ingest or in the UI with one of these modules.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers\">Persistent Identifiers</a></strong>: Module for minting and persisting persistent identifiers (Handles, DOIs, ARKs, etc.). </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> Persistent identifiers can be minted by a variety of sources, such as CrossRef, DataCite, or EZID. Regardless of the specific source, many of the tasks involved in assigning persistent identifiers to Drupal nodes are the same - providing a “Mint Identifier” button in a node edit form, integration into automated workflows, or persisting identifiers to fields on an entity.\n This module provides some common tasks while allowing small amounts of code (specifically Drupal services) to handle the particulars of minting and persisting. In addition, a Drupal site admin might want to mix and match minting and persisting services. Generally speaking, this module’s goal is to allow site admins to select the minters and persisters they want, while helpin developers to write as little code as necessary to create new minter and persister services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/mjordan/doi_datacite\">DataCite DOI Minter</a></strong>: Module that mints DOIs from DataCite via the Persistent Identifiers module. This module allows for both individual and bulk operations. \n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://github.com/mjordan/doi_datacite/raw/master/docs/images/datacite_metadata.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"DataCite DOI Minter UI\" /></figure></p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/86127144-70a21380-baad-11ea-8750-6803d0036d19.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"persistent IDs test config\" /></figure></p>\n",

A recent example of this was the survey and development of the Institutional repository Delta document. Although a IR repository is possible to assemble without a dedicated module it wouldn’t be a standardized process making community assistance a challenge. With help from the Google Scholar engineering team, the community developed with the help with feedback from the community drafted a document proposing an “Islandora Scholar” module that would bring together all the needed resources for a “turnkey” IR solution. Several options were left out deliberately that weren’t essential and could easily be accomplished with few steps from a tutorial. The Islandora interest group surveyed the community, reviewed existing IR options, and consulted with leading industry engineers. Creating a plan for a solution that meets the community’s needs and to precisely align the content in accordance with the Google Scholar engineering team’s feedback.

Please see <a href=\"cloud-hosting-solution.html\">Cloud Hosting</a> for other options.</li>\n<li>Another option is using a cloud hosted provider like any one of the numerous options Amazon’s cloud hosting provides. Again please see <a href=\"cloud-hosting-solution.html\">Cloud Hosting</a> for cloud options.</li>\n<li>Another option to include is a decoupled headless version. This solution was recently demonstrated by Discovery Gardens. It allows for all of the management side of development to be done on the Drupal server but the frontend to be a Reactjs solution. This improves speed and allows a much more flexible frontend solution to be applied. This would allow us to develop the entire site’s frontend behavior to be implemented the same way we’ve created the digital collection’s landing page. </li>\n<li>The bare minimum to run Islandora 8 in a virtual machine (<strong>for development</strong>) is 1 CPU core with 8GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. A more comprehensive specification needs to consider applications in the stack with large needs for scalability. “Cantaloupe uses a thread-per-request model, and maintains its own thread pool to carry out certain tasks asynchronously and spread work across processors. Response times will benefit from multiple fast cores.” (Deployment, 2020) Blazegraph has a few complicated tradeoffs for RAM vs harddrive performance for ideal implementations. The configuration they suggest is a 4 core (3.5GHz) system with 16GB RAM on a pair of SSDs. For 1 billion RDF triple is 83.8GB of storage/32GB if in RAM (Bebee, 2020). In conclusion for the infrastructure, the system depends on the desired scalability and performance expected. This is a full content management system with several high performance applications. </li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"ram-requirements\">RAM requirements</h4>\n<p>This is a breakdown of the core requirements from a running VM, this is bare requirements and should be discouraged to use such low RAM in awany production server.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Service</strong></th>\n<th align=\"right\"><strong>Memory (min)</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Category</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"left\">activemq</td>\n<td align=\"right\">292.10 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Middleware</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">alpaca</td>\n<td align=\"right\">521.10 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Middleware</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">blazegraph</td>\n<td align=\"right\">842.80 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Read/Write</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">cantaloupe</td>\n<td align=\"right\">915.40 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Read</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">crayfits</td>\n<td align=\"right\">53.34 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Derivative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">drupal</td>\n<td align=\"right\">96.88 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Read/Write</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">fcrepo</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1520.64 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Read/Write</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">fits</td>\n<td align=\"right\">2350.08 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Derivative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">gemini</td>\n<td align=\"right\">57.82 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Derivative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">homarus</td>\n<td align=\"right\">50.11 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Derivative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">houdini</td>\n<td align=\"right\">61.47 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Derivative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">hypercube</td>\n<td align=\"right\">50.31 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Derivative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">matomo</td>\n<td align=\"right\">50.03 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Other</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">milliner</td>\n<td align=\"right\">57.00 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Derivative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">recast</td>\n<td align=\"right\">50.03 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Derivative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">solr</td>\n<td align=\"right\">260.09 MiB</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Read/Write</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Total</td>\n<td align=\"right\"><strong>7.060 GiB</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n",

            "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>This study set out to investigate the feasibility of hosting a digital repository system in a managed way in a private cloud environment. The system that was developed was functional, usable and had an acceptable level of system performance. Thus, a private cloud is indeed a feasible option for such software systems. Current interest in containerisation of software tools, through mechanisms such as Docker, are highly compatible with cloud management systems, as they each address a different aspect of the ease of management equation. - <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-34058-2_15\">Investigating the Feasibility of Digital Repositories in Private Clouds</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although their findings were graded on user experience and less on the technical requirements it does show some promise for cloud hosting a repository. Currently there are a couple of Islandora 8 instances running in the cloud. After asking around in the community, there doesn’t seem to be any larger (more than 5TB) repositories currently running in the cloud. There are several pricing options within a cloud hosting provider. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A few solutions are available for vendors to host a solution for a fee.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Able to run the stack on a cloud hosting provider like Amazon’s AWS. The demo is running on EC2 and Lightsail (an Amazon cloud solution).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price modeling on any AWS solution is complicated and varies greatly by size and frequency of use. The task of summarizing AWS option pricing could be its own project. “In 2020, AWS comprised more than 212 services including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things.” [<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services\">link</a>]. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/aws-refarch-drupal/master/images/aws-refarch-drupal-v20170713.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"aws-refarch-drupal-v20170713\" /></figure></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><p>A few options specifically beneficial to cloud hosting include load balancing VM cluster servers (multiple identical servers) and a simple snapshot process for backing up. These can be achieved in hardware, they would require some expensive investments. Cloud hosting also makes hosting hardware unnecessary. An additional note is that some functions can be automated for either solution like scheduled backups, automated application deployment, and system monitoring. There is absolutely no mitigation of fully automated systems and application maintenance and most cloud solutions cost are prohibitively high when scaling to high numbers of CPU cores or large amounts of RAM.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A few vendors are available like Discovery Garden and Born Digital offering several options; anything from migration consultation, to migrating content from 7 to 8, develop a Islandora 8 solution that meets the institution’s needs, Islandora-as-a-service and several other options. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"other-hidden-costs\">Other Hidden Costs</h3>\n<p>Other potential “gotcha’s” that could be inflating your AWS bill include unused services started in AWS OpsWorks, unhealthy instances, and fees for excessive API calls. There are also numerous indirect costs associated with AWS and other cloud solutions in the form of performance, reliability, and cyber security problems. Misconfigured AWS servers were at fault for the recent data breaches at business associates of Verizon, the Republican National Committee, and private security firm TigerSwan. In February, numerous large websites were knocked offline due to an error by an employee at AWS, and the tech community recently expressed grave concerns about widespread chaos if AWS were to have another, larger failure, particularly since so many financial institutions rely on it. </p>\n<h3 id=\"the-cloud-isnt-always-cheaper\">The Cloud Isn’t Always Cheaper</h3>\n<p>Despite sticker shock and concerns about these hidden and indirect costs, many organizations continue to grumble and pay their AWS bill due to the misconception that cloud computing is always cheaper and more efficient than purchasing their own IT infrastructure. This is a myth. In many cases, an organization’s monthly AWS bill alone costs more than an in-house solution would. If your organization processes large amounts of data, it would probably be more cost-effective to purchase and maintain your own infrastructure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/\">Amazon suggest</a> S3 Glacier is the ideal option if low storage cost is paramount, and you do not require millisecond access to your data. Glacier can retrieve data within 1 – 5 mins if it is expedited. Standard is available which takes 3 – 5 hours. Glacier comes with a 10GB retrieval free tier per month. Amazon suggest using S3 storage if you need low latency or frequent access to your data like accessing from an image viewer or web application. According to the <a href=\"https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html\">AWS S3 Calculator</a> the storage of 10TBs of data cost $2,700 a year not including accessing or modifying the data (those are additional costs). Discovery garden currently implements a combination of these to lower the cost but couldn’t say how much and what were the drawbacks.</p>\n<p>It’s not always necessary or beneficial to abandon the cloud completely. Many organizations would greatly benefit from a hybrid approach, where they use their own infrastructure for certain tasks and utilize cloud solutions when they need additional capacity.</p>\n",

Determining the prevailing colors</li>\n<li>Oxford Common File Layout Specification (OCFL) is coming next year with the release of Fedora 6.x according to Danny Lamb and David Wilcox. This should be available within Islandora as part of upgrading Fedora to 6.x. <blockquote>\n<p>The previously mentioned disadvantages of the Fedora API may be mitigated by a relatedcommunity initiative called the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL). The OCFL is acommunity-based effort to develop “an application-independent approach to the storage ofdigital information in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed topromote long-term object management best practices within digital repositories.” The originalidea for this effort came from a Fedora Camp hosted at the University of Oxford in September2017, so it has roots in the Fedora community even though the OCFL is not dependent onFedora in any way. However, if Fedora were to store repository resources as specified by theOCFL, major upgrades in the future may become much easier. One of the primary motivatinguse cases of the OCFL is to reduce the need for data migrations; both because moving largeamounts of data is time-consuming and because such migrations risk data corruption and loss.The OCFL decouples the structure of files on disk from the application(s) that manage the filesby defining a file and folder hierarchy to which applications must conform. Thus, the files can beleft in place and new software applications can implement the OCFL specification in order tomanage the files. - [<a href=\"https://wiki.lyrasis.org/download/attachments/131533003/Designing%20a%20Migration%20Path%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf\">link</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/image_alt_fix\">Image Alt Fix</a> Improve your Drupal Website’s Section 508 Compliance by Making Images with Missing Alt Text into Accessible Images.

There are a couple of prebuilt solutions including a process that utilizes a Solr query and preconfigured mappings to achieve a full migration. Another technique utilizes the Drupal 8 module “Migrate Islandora CSV” (Lamb, 2019). As the title suggests this module utilizes a CSV file to migrate and can be generated via the Islandora 7x module “Islandora Get CSV” (Jordan, 2020).  </li>\n<li>Islandora has a few options for migrating from Islandora 7. There are 2 core migration options that Islandora supports directly; Islandora CSV migration and the migrate 7x claw (a fedora to fedora option). Another option developed was the Islandora workbench.<ul>\n<li>Islandora CSV is the preferred option for it’s simplicity. All of the migration processes in this option are both iterable and reversible. If changes need to be made to the object or it’s metadata the changes can be either updated or rolled back. This is an extremely important feature. This allows for the migration of collections of objects to be migrated with only minimal mappings (if needed). This means all RDF mapping doesn’t have to be complete to migrate the entire collection. RDF is not a flat MODS file that references some URIs. This is a problem with MODS. If a URI was to change, every MODS file must be updated to reflect the new destination. In RDF, the URI is stored and referenced as an entity and not statically in a metadata file. It’s ideal to separate out any value that will be an entity; a subject, person, place, corporation, event, etc. Regardless of the entity type the process of migration includes 3 basic steps; download the source, process it and then save it. <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85171208-8d805080-b23c-11ea-8e7a-f5638be0ca3f.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"ETL Process\" /></figure></li>\n<li>Islandora’s <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/migrate_7x_claw\">migrate_7x_claw</a></strong> module is a Drupal 8 Migrate Plus migration that  pulls content directly from an Islandora 7.x Solr/Fedora server.

This app utilizes a CSV file to import the content (objects), the base fields, and can generate new taxonomy terms when configured to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Supports ingesting objects via webforms. This is a basic fundamental functionality of Drupal 8 that Islandora leverages for all types of UI ingests and modification.</li>\n<li>Supports uploading objects via a form and having that object approved and published by another user. This mediated process is done through a standard Drupal concept called an editorial workflow. This process is for an organization that utilizes several workflows such as create, edit, review, and publish and would like to restrict access to those workflows based on roles. A full breakdown of how this is accomplished can be located at Drupal’s Editorial Workflow page (Lakatos &amp; Hodgdon, 2019).</li>\n<li>Supports self and mediated deposit. This process is identical to the previous comments on mediated workflows with the only difference being that for a self published deposit, the user should be granted the corresponding roles needed to accomplish the task.

They can represent everything from simple labels to more complex concepts such as people, places, and subjects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://github.com/DonRichards/migrate_islandora_csv/raw/gh-pages/media/posts/3/diagram.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"diagram\" /></figure></p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>Islandora 7 is a monolithic application that glues Drupal 6/7 to Fedora 3 with an optional institutional repository (IR) addon. Islandora 7 had several pain points, such as workflows, most of which required substantial coding to work around these issues. Although Islandora is  a collection of several Drupal 6/7 modules, it wasn’t written in a way that leveraged much of Drupal’s content management functionality. Fortunately the release of Drupal 8 has remedied this.</p>\n<p>Future upgrades of Drupal versions will look substantially different than before. Gone are the days of major migration planning as Drupal has completely overhauled their application lifecycle. Drupal 9 was released in June 2020 the process of upgrading won’t cause any loss in functionality or any libraries to break; the core is completely backwards compatible. This important feature was adopted  for the new life cycle for all future version releases. It was explained simply by Alex Lopez, “You’ll just get notices advising you to upgrade libraries, function calls, and anything else in your code that would make your module incompatible with a Drupal 10 version. But, theoretically, nothing that would break your module/site.”(2018). A large focus of Drupal core and module development for the 8 release was on specific industries, including but not limited to big data and higher education. “Build a wide range of solutions from university websites, applications, scholarly publishing, and more.” (Drupal for education, 2020).</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85065822-db814f80-b17b-11ea-8eb5-4ee294bae8fb.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"background\" /></figure></p>\n<p>The Drupal 8 release in 2015 had a major overhaul of the code base. This meant that upgrading from Drupal 7 into Drupal 8 broke content libraries, functions, and theming. Drupal 8’s migration is an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process as part of its Migrate API. The data can come from a variety of places; a database, CSV, JSON, or REST function, and then transformed, imported, and processed (Migrate API overview, 2019).</p>\n<p>Islandora changed the development approach to align with Drupal 8’s direction. A major focus on Islandora 8 is to build the stack in a way that fully utilizes Drupal 8 and make the contributed modules available. There are so many modules currently developed and actively managed by other institutions that provide content modeling  and developing metadata has become exceedingly easier. As the need for IRs increases, the number of options available have increased as well making it sometimes difficult to sift through to find the best option for the community. Since these modules are only a couple of years old, many of these lack sufficient documentation or guidance on how to best utilize the modules for a digital or institutional repository. The Islandora community makes every effort to bring content models together by research, community vetting, writing documentation, and creating solutions to help provide a ready made (turnkey) solution. </p>\n<p>The benefits of using Islandora 8 (i.e. Drupal 8, Solr, and a self-described “bento box” of other technology) include continuing to leverage the Drupal expertise we have in it. Using Drupal 8 for UT Collections would beneficially build on that existing knowledge and infrastructure. Islandora 8 is more closely tied to Drupal 8 than Islandora 7 was to Drupal 7, especially in terms of managing collections and object storage. For example, metadata is no longer just an XML file in Fedora that gets indexed in Solr. With Islandora 8, metadata is actually stored and managed as fields in the Drupal database. The Introduction to Islandora 8 webinar notes that “metadata profiles are created via Drupal content types” and “it can be serialized into other formats (XML, JSON, JSON-LD) on demand”. Batch metadata updates are made possible through Drupal’s Views Bulk Operations by a “Modify Field Values” operation. Metadata display is configurable in the Drupal View associated with the object type. Islandora 8 promises to make good use of Drupal this time around.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/user-intro-bento.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"I8 Bento\" /></figure></p>\n<p>Islandora 8 community developers are also proposing interesting ways of integrating IIIF, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1263\">generating IIIF manifests from Drupal Views</a> results. The downside of continuing to use Drupal for Collections has a steep learning curve for collection owners in Islandora 8, since the level of configuration possibilities has increased dynamically compared to 7, upon first look. Continuing down the Drupal path means that the Collections service must continue to offer collection owners with sufficient Drupal 8 training and support. The question that hangs on Drupal 8 is: <em>will it complicate or simplify collection building for our development team and how long would it take to migrate?</em></p>\n<p>Islandora 8 content is now utilizing Drupal nodes as the primary representation instead of how Islandora 7 overwrote Drupal routing to provide an object and it’s content. Islandora 8 content is Drupal content (stored in Fedora 5) and is completely compatible with 3rd party addons. In almost every cases the Islandora content is treated exactly the same as any other content imported into a base Drupal.</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-do-you-become-a-partner\">How do you become a partner</h4>\n<p>Partners pay $10,000 CAD each year for partner membership.\nMembers pay either $2,000 or $4,000  each year for a standard membership.</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-many-partners-are-there\">How many partners are there</h4>\n<p>As of July 2020 there are 12 partners and 24 members.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://islandora.ca/installations-map\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/86928135-2995cd00-c102-11ea-9245-a295b0de08f0.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"map\" /></figure></a></p>\n<p><strong>Partners</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>UPEI</li>\n<li>discoverygarden</li>\n<li>LYRASIS</li>\n<li>McMaster University</li>\n<li>Born-Digital</li>\n<li>University of Manitoba</li>\n<li>Florida State University</li>\n<li>Simon Fraser University</li>\n<li>University of Tennessee Knoxville</li>\n<li>Marmot Library Network</li>\n<li>University of Toronto</li>\n<li>Islandora Collaboration Group</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Members</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agile Humanities</li>\n<li>American Philosophical Society</li>\n<li>Amherst College</li>\n<li>Berklee College of Music</li>\n<li>British Columbia Electronic Library Network</li>\n<li>California Institute of Technology</li>\n<li>Chinese University of Hong Kong</li>\n<li>Delft University</li>\n<li>Digital Echidna</li>\n<li>Florida Virtual Campus</li>\n<li><strong>Johns Hopkins</strong></li>\n<li>Lib4RI</li>\n<li>Leiden University</li>\n<li>Louisiana State University</li>\n<li>Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO)</li>\n<li>Ontario Colleges Library Service</li>\n<li>PALS</li>\n<li><strong>Smithsonian Institute</strong></li>\n<li>University of Connecticut</li>\n<li>University of Nevada, Las Vegas</li>\n<li>University of Saskatchewan</li>\n<li>University of Texas at Austin</li>\n<li>Tulane University</li>\n<li>York University</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"are-there-fees-involved\">Are there fees involved</h4>\n<p>“Just a smile”, - Melissa Anez  (Islandora’s Project &amp; Community Manager)</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-is-governance-and-decision-making-handled\">How is governance and decision making handled?</h4>\n<p>By-laws: <a href=\"https://islandora.ca/if/governance\">https://islandora.ca/if/governance</a>\nGoverning group breakdown: <a href=\"https://islandora.ca/if/committees\">https://islandora.ca/if/committees</a>\nThe Role of Interest Groups(IGs): <a href=\"https://islandora.ca/collaborate\">https://islandora.ca/collaborate</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"extra\">Extra</h3>\n<p>Technical video walkthrough on Princeton’s content migration into Drupal 8. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZJuilHUIVA\" title=\"Drupal 8 &amp; Princeton University\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://image.slidesharecdn.com/princeton-university-press-status-aug2017-camp-drupalnorth-170829182326/95/princeton-university-press-to-drupal-8-migration-case-study-by-evolving-web-18-638.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Drupal 8 &amp; Princeton University\" /></figure></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"notes\">Notes</h3>\n<p>Where Do We Go From Here: A Review of Technology Solutions for Providing Access to Digital Collections: <a href=\"https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000\">https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000</a></p>\n",
