There are a couple of prebuilt solutions including a process that utilizes a Solr query and preconfigured mappings to achieve a full migration. Another technique utilizes the Drupal 8 module “Migrate Islandora CSV” (Lamb, 2019). As the title suggests this module utilizes a CSV file to migrate and can be generated via the Islandora 7x module “Islandora Get CSV” (Jordan, 2020).  </li>\n<li>Islandora a few options for migrating from Islandora 7. There are 2 core migration options that Islandora supports directly; Islandora CSV migration and the migrate 7x claw (a fedora to fedora option). Another option developed was the Islandora workbench. \n  a. Islandora CSV is the preferred option for it’s simplicity. All of the migration processes in this option are both iterable and reversible. If changes need to be made to the object or it’s metadata the changes can be either updated or rolled back. This is an extremely important fact. This allows for the migration of collections of objects to be migrated with only minimal mappings (if needed). This means all RDF mapping doesn’t have to be complete to migrate the entire collection. RDF is not a flat MODS file that references some URIs. This is a problem with MODS. If a URI was to change, every MODS file must be updated to reflect the new destination. In RDF, the URI is stored and referenced as an entity and not statically in a metadata file. It’s ideal to separate out any value that will be an entity; a subject, person, place, corporation, event, etc. Regardless of the entity type the process of migration includes 3 basic steps; download the source, process it and then save it. <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85171208-8d805080-b23c-11ea-8e7a-f5638be0ca3f.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"ETL Process\" /></figure>\n  b. Islandora’s <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/migrate_7x_claw\">migrate_7x_claw</a></strong> module is a Drupal 8 Migrate Plus migration that  pulls content directly from an Islandora 7.x Solr/Fedora server. This module assumes all PIDs are indexed in Solr.<pre><code>         - Currently, the following content models can be migrated over with full functionality:\n             * Collection\n             * Basic Image\n             * Large Image\n             * Audio\n             * Video\n             * PDF\n             * Binary</code></pre>  c. Supports batch ingest of objects through the Islandora Workbench repository (Jordan, 2020). This app utilizes a CSV file to import the content (objects), the base fields, and can generate new taxonomy terms when configured to do so.</li>\n<li>Supports ingesting objects via webforms. This is a basic fundamental functionality of Drupal 8 that Islandora leverages for all types of UI ingests and modification.</li>\n<li>Supports uploading objects via a form and having that object approved and published by another user. This mediated process is done through a standard Drupal concept called an editorial workflow. This process is for an organization that utilizes several workflows such as create, edit, review, and publish and would like to restrict access to those workflows based on roles. A full breakdown of how this is accomplished can be located at Drupal’s Editorial Workflow page (Lakatos &amp; Hodgdon, 2019).</li>\n<li>Supports self and mediated deposit. This process is identical to the previous comments on mediated workflows with the only difference being that for a self published deposit, the user should be granted the corresponding roles needed to accomplish the task. </li>\n<li>Supports uploading any binary file type. Islandora 8 treats all repository items as a binary content type. Binary files are treated the same as any other content type, a model tag is applied to an object/node indicating to Drupal which context(s) to use resulting in corresponding actions to be fired.</li>\n</ol>\n",

This is all done via the Repository Item content model which contains nearly all of the fields necessary to describe any type of object, and is the core of most of Islandora 8’s Drupal features. Many Drupal views and contexts can be triggered by targeting one or more of the fields in a Repository Item node in a way that makes requiring separate content types unnecessary.

Although Islandora is  a collection of several Drupal 6/7 modules, it wasn’t written in a way that leveraged much of Drupal’s content management functionality. Fortunately for 8 this has been remedied.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85065965-0cfa1b00-b17c-11ea-83c6-cb08ebd23ff9.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"I8\" /></figure></p>\n<p>The Drupal 8 release in 2015 had a major overhaul of the code base. This meant that upgrading from Drupal 7 into Drupal 8 broke content libraries, functions, and theming. Drupal 8’s migration is an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process as part of its Migrate API. The data can come from a variety of places; a database, CSV, JSON, or REST function, and then transformed, imported, and processed (Migrate API overview, 2019).</p>\n<p>Future upgrades of Drupal versions will look substantially different than before. Gone are the days of major migration planning as Drupal has completely overhauled their application lifecycle. With Drupal 9 being released in June 2020 the process of upgrading won’t cause any loss in functionality or any libraries to break; the core is completely backwards compatible. This important feature was adopted  for the new life cycle for all future version releases. It was explained simply by Alex Lopez, “You’ll just get notices advising you to upgrade libraries, function calls, and anything else in your code that would make your module incompatible with a Drupal 10 version. But, theoretically, nothing that would break your module/site.”(2018). A large focus of Drupal core and module development for the 8 release was on specific industries, including but not limited to big data and higher education. “Build a wide range of solutions from university websites, applications, scholarly publishing, and more.” (Drupal for education, 2020).</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85065822-db814f80-b17b-11ea-8eb5-4ee294bae8fb.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"background\" /></figure></p>\n<p>Islandora changed the development approach to align with Drupal 8’s direction. A major focus on Islandora 8 is to build the stack in a way that fully utilizes Drupal 8 and make the contributed modules available. There are so many modules currently  developed and actively managed by other institutions that provide content modeling  and developing metadata has become exceedingly easier. As the need for IRs increases, the number of options available have increased as well making it sometimes difficult to sift through to find the best option for the community. Since these are so new, many of these lack sufficient documentation or guidance on how to best utilize the modules for a digital or institutional repository. The Islandora community makes every effort to bring content models together by research, community vetting, writing documentation, and creating solutions to help provide a ready made (turn key) solution.Islandora 8 content is now utilizing Drupal nodes as the primary representation instead of how Islandora 7 overwrote Drupal routing to provide an object and it’s content. Islandora 8 content is Drupal content (stored in Fedora 5) and is completely compatible with 3rd party addons.</p>\n",
