The Migrate module only provides the framework, it’s up to you to create the rules that take data from a source, through a process (i.e. a mapping) to a destination. A set of these rules is called a “migration”. It has to be set up (as a Configuration Entity, either by importing a YAML file or by installing a Feature) and then it has to be ran. In a nutshell the steps are the following</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a CSV file.</li>\n<li>Create a yml for each type of entity (person, place, event, university, etc) needing to mint. </li>\n<li>Create a “file” yml configuration file for the files.</li>\n<li>Create a “media” yml configuration file for the files to specify their media behavior once in Drupal.</li>\n<li>Create a “node” yml configuration file for gluing the file and media to a node. It the Islandora 7 terminology this would be the “object”.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/86034395-88738c00-ba08-11ea-8aaa-48bea9d0cc97.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Screenshot of Migrate UI\" /></figure></p>\n<p>Althought this process can be done in the admin UI, it’s highly suggested to use drush commands.

PHP’s integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit integers, some filesystem functions may return unexpected results for files which are larger than 2GB and could cause <code>filesize</code> to report the UI an incurrate reading. It won’t cause functions to fail just to not report correctly. This is a reported flaw within <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filesize.php\">PHP</a>. </p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://iiif.io\">IIIF</a> (International Image Interoperability Framework) is a set of specifications that provides interoperability of image-based collections across platforms. What this means for a repository platform like Islandora at a general level is that image-based objects such as (still) images and paged content can be managed by Islandora but viewed in external applications, and that Islandora can bring in image-based content from elsewhere to supplement locally managed content. If this intrigues you, see the section “Looking under the hood (and beyond)” below.</p>\n<p>At a practial level, because Islandora supports several of the IIIF specifications, we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zoom, pan, and rotate images within OpenSeadragon</li>\n<li>Islandora uses an IIIF-compliant image server (by default, <a href=\"https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/\">Cantaloupe</a>) that utilizes the IIIF Image API. This capablity is similar to what Islandora 7.x users experience when they view a Large Image.</li>\n<li>Display thumbnails for all pages of a book or newspaper issue within image viewers</li>\n<li>IIIF-compliant image viewers such as OpenSeadragon or Mirador can display a “collection” of images such as all the pages of a book or newspaper issue using the <a href=\"https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/\">IIIF Presentation API</a>. For example, here is a screenshot of OpenSeadragon rendering all the pages of a book: <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/osd_collection_mode.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"pages of a book\" /></figure></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"using-iiif-in-islandora-8\">Using IIIF in Islandora 8</h3>\n<p>Implementation of the IIIF Presentation API is new in Islandora 8, and using it is as simple as configuring a Context (in fact, you don’t even need to configure it; the Context, Openseadragon Block, already exists by default). To use this Context, all that is required is for your book or newspaper (or other paged content) to be given a model of “Paged Content” or “Publication Issue”. Then, in the Openseadragon Block Context, make sure the term used in the “Node has term” condition (you can register more than one term there). Now, when you view a paged content Islandora object, you will see thumbnails of all of its child pages (assuming you have added some child pages to the object) in the OpenSeadragon viewer as illustrated above.</p>\n<p>To view an object’s <strong>manifest</strong> navigate to the node’s URL and add <code>/manifest</code></p>\n<p>Example: <code>http://myrepo.edu/node/23/manifest</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"bonus\">Bonus</h3>\n<p>IIIF-compliant viewers don’t need to be embedded in Islandora websites. If a viewer on another website knows the URL of a IIIF manifest like the ones that Islandora can produce, that viewer can display the content described in the manifest. Here’s an example of how a viewer can display from multiple external domains with just a manifest.\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85555851-4e634e00-b5f4-11ea-8bef-496bc6357385.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Mirador example with multiple sources\" /></figure></p>\n<p>For more information see Islandora’s documentation on <a href=\"https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/iiif/#using-iiif-in-islandora-8\">Using iiif in Islandora 8</a>.

Here is an example of Mark Jordan’s module that provides a collection of graphical reports on various aspects of an Islandora repository. <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_repository_reports/raw/master/docs/images/random_pie.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"pie chart\" /></figure> <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_repository_reports/raw/master/docs/images/random_bar.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"bar chart\" /></figure></li>\n<li>“Supports logging of manual dashboard processes by authenticated users” <strong>I am uncertain as to what this is referring to at this time.</strong></li>\n<li>Like any other web servers, Islandora 8 can be hosted locally. The biggest benefits are leveraging the power of CPU multithreading and large memory size utilization are the most cost effective. However, self hosted hardware costs money to maintain and upgrade. Please see <a href=\"cloud-hosting-solution.html\">Cloud Hosting</a> for other options.</li>\n<li>Another option is using a cloud hosted provider like any one of the numerous options Amazon’s cloud hosting provides. Again please see <a href=\"cloud-hosting-solution.html\">Cloud Hosting</a> for cloud options.</li>\n<li>Another option to include is a decoupled headless version. This solution was recently demonstrated by Discovery Gardens. It allows for all of the management side of development to be done on the Drupal server but the frontend to be a Reactjs solution. This improves speed and allows a much more flexible frontend solution to be applied. This would allow us to develop the entire site’s frontend behavior to be implemented the same way we’ve created the digital collection’s landing page. </li>\n<li>The bare minimum to run Islandora 8 in a virtual machine (for development) is 1 CPU core with 4GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. A more comprehensive specification needs to consider applications in the stack with large needs for scalability. “Cantaloupe uses a thread-per-request model, and maintains its own thread pool to carry out certain tasks asynchronously and spread work across processors. Response times will benefit from multiple fast cores.” (Deployment, 2020) Blazegraph has a few complicated tradeoffs for RAM vs harddrive performance for ideal implementations. The configuration they suggest is a 4 core (3.5GHz) system with 16GB RAM on a pair of SSDs. For 1 billion RDF triple is 83.8GB of storage/32GB if in RAM (Bebee, 2020). In conclusion for the infrastructure, the system depends on the desired scalability and performance expected. This is a full content management system with several high performance applications.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Although Fedora offers WebAC access control as a solution to regulate access to Fedora resources, it was determined not to be granular enough for most of the Islandora community.

Drupal’s access management is far more rebust and is easier to configure.

This should be available within Islandora as part of upgrading Fedora to 6.x. <blockquote>\n<p>The previously mentioned disadvantages of the Fedora API may be mitigated by a relatedcommunity initiative called the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL). The OCFL is acommunity-based effort to develop “an application-independent approach to the storage ofdigital information in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed topromote long-term object management best practices within digital repositories.” The originalidea for this effort came from a Fedora Camp hosted at the University of Oxford in September2017, so it has roots in the Fedora community even though the OCFL is not dependent onFedora in any way. However, if Fedora were to store repository resources as specified by theOCFL, major upgrades in the future may become much easier. One of the primary motivatinguse cases of the OCFL is to reduce the need for data migrations; both because moving largeamounts of data is time-consuming and because such migrations risk data corruption and loss.The OCFL decouples the structure of files on disk from the application(s) that manage the filesby defining a file and folder hierarchy to which applications must conform. Thus, the files can beleft in place and new software applications can implement the OCFL specification in order tomanage the files. - [<a href=\"https://wiki.lyrasis.org/download/attachments/131533003/Designing%20a%20Migration%20Path%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf\">link</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/image_alt_fix\">Image Alt Fix</a> Improve your Drupal Website’s Section 508 Compliance by Making Images with Missing Alt Text into Accessible Images.

All images are labeled with a role attribute of presentation until the alt text is added. If the image should not have alt text, then permanently change the image record to only be for presentation, which will effectively hide it from screen readers.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Another option developed was the Islandora workbench.<ul>\n<li>Islandora CSV is the preferred option for it’s simplicity. All of the migration processes in this option are both iterable and reversible. If changes need to be made to the object or it’s metadata the changes can be either updated or rolled back. This is an extremely important fact. This allows for the migration of collections of objects to be migrated with only minimal mappings (if needed). This means all RDF mapping doesn’t have to be complete to migrate the entire collection. RDF is not a flat MODS file that references some URIs. This is a problem with MODS. If a URI was to change, every MODS file must be updated to reflect the new destination. In RDF, the URI is stored and referenced as an entity and not statically in a metadata file. It’s ideal to separate out any value that will be an entity; a subject, person, place, corporation, event, etc. Regardless of the entity type the process of migration includes 3 basic steps; download the source, process it and then save it. <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85171208-8d805080-b23c-11ea-8e7a-f5638be0ca3f.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"ETL Process\" /></figure></li>\n<li>Islandora’s <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/migrate_7x_claw\">migrate_7x_claw</a></strong> module is a Drupal 8 Migrate Plus migration that  pulls content directly from an Islandora 7.x Solr/Fedora server. This module assumes all PIDs are indexed in Solr.<pre><code>       - Currently, the following content models can be migrated over with full functionality:\n           * Collection\n           * Basic Image\n           * Large Image\n           * Audio\n           * Video\n           * PDF\n           * Binary</code></pre></li>\n<li>Islandora 8 supports batch ingest of objects through the Islandora Workbench repository (Jordan, 2020). This app utilizes a CSV file to import the content (objects), the base fields, and can generate new taxonomy terms when configured to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Supports ingesting objects via webforms. This is a basic fundamental functionality of Drupal 8 that Islandora leverages for all types of UI ingests and modification.</li>\n<li>Supports uploading objects via a form and having that object approved and published by another user. This mediated process is done through a standard Drupal concept called an editorial workflow. This process is for an organization that utilizes several workflows such as create, edit, review, and publish and would like to restrict access to those workflows based on roles. A full breakdown of how this is accomplished can be located at Drupal’s Editorial Workflow page (Lakatos &amp; Hodgdon, 2019).</li>\n<li>Supports self and mediated deposit. This process is identical to the previous comments on mediated workflows with the only difference being that for a self published deposit, the user should be granted the corresponding roles needed to accomplish the task. Please see <a href=\"step-by-step-setup-ir.html\">Step by Step Setup of Islandora 8 Scholar</a> for more information on how to set it up. <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85894536-eadb4b00-b7c2-11ea-86e5-fd7b0b825b59.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Islandora 8 Scholar Screenshots\" /></figure></li>\n<li>Supports uploading any binary file type. Islandora 8 treats all repository items as a binary content type. Binary files are treated the same as any other content type, a model tag is applied to an object/node indicating to Drupal which context(s) to use resulting in corresponding actions to be fired.</li>\n</ol>\n",

This is all done via the Repository Item content model which contains nearly all of the fields necessary to describe any type of object, and is the core of most of Islandora 8’s Drupal features.

            "content_html": "<p>Islandora 7 is a monolithic application that glues Drupal 6/7 to Fedora 3 with an optional institutional repository (IR) addon. Islandora 7 had several pain points, such as workflows, most of which required substantial coding to work around these issues. Although Islandora is  a collection of several Drupal 6/7 modules, it wasn’t written in a way that leveraged much of Drupal’s content management functionality. Fortunately the release of Drupal 8 has remedied this.</p>\n<p>The Drupal 8 release in 2015 had a major overhaul of the code base. This meant that upgrading from Drupal 7 into Drupal 8 broke content libraries, functions, and theming. Drupal 8’s migration is an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process as part of its Migrate API. The data can come from a variety of places; a database, CSV, JSON, or REST function, and then transformed, imported, and processed (Migrate API overview, 2019).</p>\n<p>Future upgrades of Drupal versions will look substantially different than before. Gone are the days of major migration planning as Drupal has completely overhauled their application lifecycle. Drupal 9 was released in June 2020 the process of upgrading won’t cause any loss in functionality or any libraries to break; the core is completely backwards compatible. This important feature was adopted  for the new life cycle for all future version releases. It was explained simply by Alex Lopez, “You’ll just get notices advising you to upgrade libraries, function calls, and anything else in your code that would make your module incompatible with a Drupal 10 version. But, theoretically, nothing that would break your module/site.”(2018). A large focus of Drupal core and module development for the 8 release was on specific industries, including but not limited to big data and higher education. “Build a wide range of solutions from university websites, applications, scholarly publishing, and more.” (Drupal for education, 2020).</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85065822-db814f80-b17b-11ea-8eb5-4ee294bae8fb.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"background\" /></figure></p>\n<p>Islandora changed the development approach to align with Drupal 8’s direction. A major focus on Islandora 8 is to build the stack in a way that fully utilizes Drupal 8 and make the contributed modules available. There are so many modules currently  developed and actively managed by other institutions that provide content modeling  and developing metadata has become exceedingly easier. As the need for IRs increases, the number of options available have increased as well making it sometimes difficult to sift through to find the best option for the community. Since these are so new, many of these lack sufficient documentation or guidance on how to best utilize the modules for a digital or institutional repository. The Islandora community makes every effort to bring content models together by research, community vetting, writing documentation, and creating solutions to help provide a ready made (turnkey) solution. Islandora 8 content is now utilizing Drupal nodes as the primary representation instead of how Islandora 7 overwrote Drupal routing to provide an object and it’s content. Islandora 8 content is Drupal content (stored in Fedora 5) and is completely compatible with 3rd party addons. In almost every cases the Islandora content is treated exactly the same as any other content imported into a base Drupal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"extra\">Extra</h3>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://arc-hum.princeton.edu/sites/arc_hum/files/styles/pwds_featured_image/public/news/princeton-logo_1.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Princton Diagram\" /></figure> \nHere’s a technical video on Princeton’s content migration to Drupal 8 </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZJuilHUIVA\" title=\"Drupal 8 &amp; Princeton University\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://image.slidesharecdn.com/princeton-university-press-status-aug2017-camp-drupalnorth-170829182326/95/princeton-university-press-to-drupal-8-migration-case-study-by-evolving-web-18-638.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Drupal 8 &amp; Princeton University\" /></figure></a></p>\n",
