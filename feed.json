            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://iiif.io\">IIIF</a> (International Image Interoperability Framework) is a set of specifications that provides interoperability of image-based collections across platforms. What this means for a repository platform like Islandora at a general level is that image-based objects such as (still) images and paged content can be managed by Islandora but viewed in external applications, and that Islandora can bring in image-based content from elsewhere to supplement locally managed content. If this intrigues you, see the section “Looking under the hood (and beyond)” below.</p>\n<p>At a practial level, because Islandora supports several of the IIIF specifications, we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zoom, pan, and rotate images within OpenSeadragon</li>\n<li>Islandora uses an IIIF-compliant image server (by default, <a href=\"https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/\">Cantaloupe</a>) that utilizes the IIIF Image API. This capablity is similar to what Islandora 7.x users experience when they view a Large Image.</li>\n<li>Display thumbnails for all pages of a book or newspaper issue within image viewers</li>\n<li>IIIF-compliant image viewers such as OpenSeadragon or Mirador can display a “collection” of images such as all the pages of a book or newspaper issue using the <a href=\"https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/\">IIIF Presentation API</a>. For example, here is a screenshot of OpenSeadragon rendering all the pages of a book: <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/osd_collection_mode.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"pages of a book\" /></figure></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"using-iiif-in-islandora-8\">Using IIIF in Islandora 8</h3>\n<p>Implementation of the IIIF Presentation API is new in Islandora 8, and using it is as simple as configuring a Context (in fact, you don’t even need to configure it; the Context, Openseadragon Block, already exists by default). To use this Context, all that is required is for your book or newspaper (or other paged content) to be given a model of “Paged Content” or “Publication Issue”. Then, in the Openseadragon Block Context, make sure the term used in the “Node has term” condition (you can register more than one term there). Now, when you view a paged content Islandora object, you will see thumbnails of all of its child pages (assuming you have added some child pages to the object) in the OpenSeadragon viewer as illustrated above.</p>\n<p>To view an object’s <strong>manifest</strong> navigate to the node’s URL and add <code>/manifest</code></p>\n<p>Example: <code>http://myrepo.edu/node/23/manifest</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"bonus\">Bonus</h3>\n<p>IIIF-compliant viewers don’t need to be embedded in Islandora websites. If a viewer on another website knows the URL of a IIIF manifest like the ones that Islandora can produce, that viewer can display the content described in the manifest. Here’s an example of how a viewer can display from multiple external domains with just a manifest.\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85555851-4e634e00-b5f4-11ea-8bef-496bc6357385.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Mirador example with multiple sources\" /></figure></p>\n<p>For more information see Islandora’s documentation on <a href=\"https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/iiif/#using-iiif-in-islandora-8\">Using iiif in Islandora 8</a>.

Please see <a href=\"cloud-hosting-solution.html\">Cloud Hosting</a> for other options.</li>\n<li>Another option is using a cloud hosted provider like any one of the numerous options Amazon’s cloud hosting provides. Again please see <a href=\"cloud-hosting-solution.html\">Cloud Hosting</a> for cloud options.</li>\n<li>Another option to include is a decoupled headless version. This solution was recently demonstrated by Discovery Gardens. It allows for all of the management side of development to be done on the Drupal server but the frontend to be a Reactjs solution. This improves speed and allows a much more flexible frontend solution to be applied. This would allow us to develop the entire site’s frontend behavior to be implemented the same way we’ve created the digital collection’s landing page. </li>\n<li>The bare minimum to run Islandora 8 in a virtual machine (for development) is 1 CPU core with 4GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. A more comprehensive specification needs to consider applications in the stack with large needs for scalability. “Cantaloupe uses a thread-per-request model, and maintains its own thread pool to carry out certain tasks asynchronously and spread work across processors. Response times will benefit from multiple fast cores.” (Deployment, 2020) Blazegraph has a few complicated tradeoffs for RAM vs harddrive performance for ideal implementations. The configuration they suggest is a 4 core (3.5GHz) system with 16GB RAM on a pair of SSDs. For 1 billion RDF triple is 83.8GB of storage/32GB if in RAM (Bebee, 2020). In conclusion for the infrastructure, the system depends on the desired scalability and performance expected. This is a full content management system with several high performance applications.</li>\n</ol>\n",
