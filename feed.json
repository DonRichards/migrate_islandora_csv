The Migrate module only provides the framework, it’s up to you to create the rules that take data from a source, through a process (i.e. a mapping) to a destination. A set of these rules is called a “migration”. It has to be set up (as a Configuration Entity, either by importing a YAML file or by installing a Feature) and then it has to be ran. In a nutshell the steps are the following</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a CSV file.</li>\n<li>Create a yml for each type of entity (person, place, event, university, etc) needing to mint. </li>\n<li>Create a “file” yml configuration file for the files.</li>\n<li>Create a “media” yml configuration file for the files to specify their media behavior once in Drupal.</li>\n<li>Create a “node” yml configuration file for gluing the file and media to a node.

PHP’s integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit integers, some filesystem functions may return unexpected results for files which are larger than 2GB and could cause <code>filesize</code> to report the UI an incurrate reading. It won’t cause functions to fail just to not report correctly. This is a reported flaw within <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filesize.php\">PHP</a>. </p>\n",

The Drupal 8 module <em>permissions_by_term</em> and the sub-module <em>permissions_by_entity</em> allows us to create a ‘ETD-submission’ term that, when applied to nodes and media will restrict access to them (and files as an extension of media) to permission group members.</p>\n<p>However, access to files will only be checked if they are in a managed filesystem such as the Drupal private filesystem or one provided by a Flysystem adapter (like the Fedora Adapter provided by Islandora 8). When Islandora 8 creates derivate media it places them in the public filesystem by default. This is generally a good idea because it is more performant than other filesystems but then derivatives of restricted items become publicly accessible, which is not what we want. A repository manager can change the derivative actions to save them into either the private of Fedora filesystems, but this comes at a performance cost when accessing files that are publicly accessible.</p>\n<p>Enter <em>file_access_fix</em>. This handy module will check an entity (node, media, etc.) on update to see if it has any referenced files. If so, it will check if the entity is available by Anonymous users and will move the file to the appropriate filesystem, either public or private, based on it’s availability. So, if I create a derivative that is saved in the private filesystem by default, this module will check to see if the media is publicly accessible, if so, it will move it to the more performant public filesystem for me! If I ever decide that the media actually should be restricted, the module will move the file from the public filesystem back to the private one.

Mainly the content hosted on your website must consist primarily of scholarly articles - journal papers, conference papers, technical reports, or their drafts, dissertations, pre-prints, post-prints, or abstracts. Content such as news or magazine articles, book reviews, and editorials is not appropriate for Google Scholar. Content must make either the full text of the articles or their complete author-written abstracts freely available above the fold. There are several other restrictions that can be found at <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#overview\">Google Scholar Inclusion Guidelines</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"metatag-google-scholar\"><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag_google_scholar\">Metatag Google Scholar</a></h4>\n<p>Currently the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag_google_scholar\">Metatag Google Scholar</a> along with the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag\">metatag</a> modules adds the following <em>Highwire Press</em> tags:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>citation_title</li>\n<li>citation_author</li>\n<li>citation_publication_date</li>\n<li>citation_journal_title</li>\n<li>citation_issn</li>\n<li>citation_isbn</li>\n<li>citation_volume</li>\n<li>citation_issue</li>\n<li>citation_firstpage</li>\n<li>citation_lastpage</li>\n<li>citation_dissertation_institution</li>\n<li>citation_technical_report_institution</li>\n<li>citation_technical_report_number</li>\n<li>citation_pdf_url</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_title&quot; content=&quot;The testis isoform of the phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit (PhK-T) plays a critical role in regulation of glycogen mobilization in developing lung&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Liu, Li&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Rannels, Stephen R.&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Falconieri, Mary&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Phillips, Karen S.&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Wolpert, Ellen B.&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Weaver, Timothy E.&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_publication_date&quot; content=&quot;1996/05/17&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_journal_title&quot; content=&quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_volume&quot; content=&quot;271&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_issue&quot; content=&quot;20&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_firstpage&quot; content=&quot;11761&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_lastpage&quot; content=&quot;11766&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_pdf_url&quot; content=&quot;http://www.example.com/content/271/20/11761.full.pdf&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The title tag, e.g., citation_title or DC.title, must contain the title of the paper. Don’t use it for the title of the journal or a book in which the paper was published, or for the name of your repository. This tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>\n<p>The author tag, e.g., citation_author or DC.creator, must contain the authors (and only the actual authors) of the paper. Don’t use it for the author of the website or for contributors other than authors, e.g., thesis advisors. Author names can be listed either as “Smith, John” or as “John Smith”. Put each author name in a separate tag and omit all affiliations, degrees, certifications, etc., from this field. At least one author tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>\n<p>The publication date tag, e.g., citation_publication_date or DC.issued, must contain the date of publication, i.e., the date that would normally be cited in references to this paper from other papers. Don’t use it for the date of entry into the repository - that should go into citation_online_date instead. Provide full dates in the “2010/5/12” format if available; or a year alone otherwise. This tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>\n<p>For journal and conference papers, provide the remaining bibliographic citation data in the following tags: citation_journal_title or citation_conference_title, citation_issn, citation_isbn, citation_volume, citation_issue, citation_firstpage, and citation_lastpage. Dublin Core equivalents are DC.relation.ispartof for journal and conference titles and the non-standard tags DC.citation.volume, DC.citation.issue, DC.citation.spage (start page), and DC.citation.epage (end page) for the remaining fields. Regardless of the scheme chosen, these fields must contain sufficient information to identify a reference to this paper from another document, which is normally all of: (a) journal or conference name, (b) volume and issue numbers, if applicable, and (c) the number of the first page of the paper in the volume (or issue) in question.</p>\n<p>For theses, dissertations, and technical reports, provide the remaining bibliographic citation data in the following tags: citation_dissertation_institution, citation_technical_report_institution or DC.publisher for the name of the institution and citation_technical_report_number for the number of the technical report. As with journal and conference papers, you need to provide sufficient information to recognize a formal citation to this document from another article.</p>\n<p>For all document types, the guiding principle is to present your article as it would normally be cited in the “References” section of another paper. E.g., citations to technical reports normally include their assigned numbers, so the number of the report should be present in some appropriate field. Likewise, the name of the journal should be written as “Transactions on Magic Realism” or “Trans. Mag. Real.”, not as “Magic Realism, Transactions on” or “T12”. Omission or unusual presentation of key bibliographic fields can lead to mis-identification of your articles.</p>\n<p>All tag values are HTML attributes, so you must escape special characters appropriately. E.g., <meta name=\"citation_title\" content=\"&quot;Andar com meus sapatos&quot; - uma an&#225;lise cr&#237;tica\">. There’s no need to escape characters that are written directly in your webpage’s character encoding, such as Latin diacritics on a page in ISO-8859-1. However, you must still escape the quotes and the angle brackets.</p>\n<p>The “<meta>“ tags normally apply only to the exact page on which they’re provided. If this page shows only the abstract of the paper and you have the full text in a separate file, e.g., in the PDF format, please specify the locations of all full text versions using citation_pdf_url or DC.identifier tags. The content of the tag is the absolute URL of the PDF file; for security reasons, it must refer to a file in the same subdirectory as the HTML abstract.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sharing--metadata\">Sharing  Metadata</h3>\n<p>Please see OAI-PMH </p>\n<h3 id=\"embargos\">Embargos</h3>\n<p>A short demo of the major functionality of the Drupal 8 Embargoes module for the Islandora community, using the Islandora 8 Vagrant virtual machine and Repository Item type nodes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pUi8G8uxcU\" title=\"Embargoes demo for Islandora 8\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/5pUi8G8uxcU/0.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Embargoes demo for Islandora 8\" /></figure></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"tombstoning\">Tombstoning</h3>\n<p>…</p>\n<h3 id=\"other\">Other</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google Scholar’s inclusion requirements, documents larger than 5MB, such as books and long dissertations, should be uploaded to Google Book Search. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although not common I can’t seem to locate a ready made solution for uploading content from Drupal 8 into Google Book Search’s API.

            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://iiif.io\">IIIF</a> (International Image Interoperability Framework) is a set of specifications that provides interoperability of image-based collections across platforms. What this means for a repository platform like Islandora at a general level is that image-based objects such as (still) images and paged content can be managed by Islandora but viewed in external applications, and that Islandora can bring in image-based content from elsewhere to supplement locally managed content. If this intrigues you, see the section “Looking under the hood (and beyond)” below.</p>\n<p>At a practial level, because Islandora supports several of the IIIF specifications, we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zoom, pan, and rotate images within OpenSeadragon</li>\n<li>Islandora uses an IIIF-compliant image server (by default, <a href=\"https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/\">Cantaloupe</a>) that utilizes the IIIF Image API. This capablity is similar to what Islandora 7.x users experience when they view a Large Image.</li>\n<li>Display thumbnails for all pages of a book or newspaper issue within image viewers</li>\n<li>IIIF-compliant image viewers such as OpenSeadragon or Mirador can display a “collection” of images such as all the pages of a book or newspaper issue using the <a href=\"https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/\">IIIF Presentation API</a>. For example, here is a screenshot of OpenSeadragon rendering all the pages of a book: <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/osd_collection_mode.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"pages of a book\" /></figure></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"using-iiif-in-islandora-8\">Using IIIF in Islandora 8</h3>\n<p>Implementation of the IIIF Presentation API is new in Islandora 8, and using it is as simple as configuring a Context (in fact, you don’t even need to configure it; the Context, Openseadragon Block, already exists by default). To use this Context, all that is required is for your book or newspaper (or other paged content) to be given a model of “Paged Content” or “Publication Issue”. Then, in the Openseadragon Block Context, make sure the term used in the “Node has term” condition (you can register more than one term there). Now, when you view a paged content Islandora object, you will see thumbnails of all of its child pages (assuming you have added some child pages to the object) in the OpenSeadragon viewer as illustrated above.</p>\n<p>To view an object’s <strong>manifest</strong> navigate to the node’s URL and add <code>/manifest</code></p>\n<p>Example: <code>http://myrepo.edu/node/23/manifest</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"bonus\">Bonus</h3>\n<p>IIIF-compliant viewers don’t need to be embedded in Islandora websites. If a viewer on another website knows the URL of a IIIF manifest like the ones that Islandora can produce, that viewer can display the content described in the manifest. Here’s an example of how a viewer can display from multiple external domains with just a manifest.\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85555851-4e634e00-b5f4-11ea-8bef-496bc6357385.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Mirador example with multiple sources\" /></figure></p>\n<p>For more information see Islandora’s documentation on <a href=\"https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/iiif/#using-iiif-in-islandora-8\">Using iiif in Islandora 8</a>.

Regardless of the specific source, many of the tasks involved in assigning persistent identifiers to Drupal nodes are the same - providing a &quot;Mint Identifier&quot; button in a node edit form, integration into automated workflows, or persisting identifiers to fields on an entity.\n\n  This module provides some common tasks while allowing small amounts of code (specifically Drupal services) to handle the particulars of minting and persisting. In addition, a Drupal site admin might want to mix and match minting and persisting services. Generally speaking, this module&#39;s goal is to allow site admins to select the minters and persisters they want, while helpin developers to write as little code as necessary to create new minter and persister services.</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mjordan/doi_datacite\">DataCite DOI Minter</a>: Module that mints DOIs from DataCite via the Persistent Identifiers module.

Please see <a href=\"cloud-hosting-solution.html\">Cloud Hosting</a> for other options.</li>\n<li>Another option is using a cloud hosted provider like any one of the numerous options Amazon’s cloud hosting provides. Again please see <a href=\"cloud-hosting-solution.html\">Cloud Hosting</a> for cloud options.</li>\n<li>Another option to include is a decoupled headless version. This solution was recently demonstrated by Discovery Gardens. It allows for all of the management side of development to be done on the Drupal server but the frontend to be a Reactjs solution. This improves speed and allows a much more flexible frontend solution to be applied. This would allow us to develop the entire site’s frontend behavior to be implemented the same way we’ve created the digital collection’s landing page. </li>\n<li>The bare minimum to run Islandora 8 in a virtual machine (for development) is 1 CPU core with 4GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. A more comprehensive specification needs to consider applications in the stack with large needs for scalability. “Cantaloupe uses a thread-per-request model, and maintains its own thread pool to carry out certain tasks asynchronously and spread work across processors. Response times will benefit from multiple fast cores.” (Deployment, 2020) Blazegraph has a few complicated tradeoffs for RAM vs harddrive performance for ideal implementations. The configuration they suggest is a 4 core (3.5GHz) system with 16GB RAM on a pair of SSDs. For 1 billion RDF triple is 83.8GB of storage/32GB if in RAM (Bebee, 2020). In conclusion for the infrastructure, the system depends on the desired scalability and performance expected. This is a full content management system with several high performance applications.</li>\n</ol>\n",

This should be available within Islandora as part of upgrading Fedora to 6.x. <blockquote>\n<p>The previously mentioned disadvantages of the Fedora API may be mitigated by a relatedcommunity initiative called the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL). The OCFL is acommunity-based effort to develop “an application-independent approach to the storage ofdigital information in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed topromote long-term object management best practices within digital repositories.” The originalidea for this effort came from a Fedora Camp hosted at the University of Oxford in September2017, so it has roots in the Fedora community even though the OCFL is not dependent onFedora in any way. However, if Fedora were to store repository resources as specified by theOCFL, major upgrades in the future may become much easier. One of the primary motivatinguse cases of the OCFL is to reduce the need for data migrations; both because moving largeamounts of data is time-consuming and because such migrations risk data corruption and loss.The OCFL decouples the structure of files on disk from the application(s) that manage the filesby defining a file and folder hierarchy to which applications must conform. Thus, the files can beleft in place and new software applications can implement the OCFL specification in order tomanage the files. - [<a href=\"https://wiki.lyrasis.org/download/attachments/131533003/Designing%20a%20Migration%20Path%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf\">link</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/image_alt_fix\">Image Alt Fix</a> Improve your Drupal Website’s Section 508 Compliance by Making Images with Missing Alt Text into Accessible Images.

All images are labeled with a role attribute of presentation until the alt text is added.

In controlled_access_terms, we have an understanding of a typed_relation, which is an entity reference coupled with a MARC relator.

Automatically generating the subject from within the node migration limits to only the title. Whereas a separate migration allows for all 3 fields to be imported and referenced.

There are a couple of prebuilt solutions including a process that utilizes a Solr query and preconfigured mappings to achieve a full migration. Another technique utilizes the Drupal 8 module “Migrate Islandora CSV” (Lamb, 2019). As the title suggests this module utilizes a CSV file to migrate and can be generated via the Islandora 7x module “Islandora Get CSV” (Jordan, 2020).  </li>\n<li>Islandora has a few options for migrating from Islandora 7. There are 2 core migration options that Islandora supports directly; Islandora CSV migration and the migrate 7x claw (a fedora to fedora option). Another option developed was the Islandora workbench.<ul>\n<li>Islandora CSV is the preferred option for it’s simplicity. All of the migration processes in this option are both iterable and reversible. If changes need to be made to the object or it’s metadata the changes can be either updated or rolled back. This is an extremely important feature. This allows for the migration of collections of objects to be migrated with only minimal mappings (if needed). This means all RDF mapping doesn’t have to be complete to migrate the entire collection. RDF is not a flat MODS file that references some URIs. This is a problem with MODS. If a URI was to change, every MODS file must be updated to reflect the new destination. In RDF, the URI is stored and referenced as an entity and not statically in a metadata file. It’s ideal to separate out any value that will be an entity; a subject, person, place, corporation, event, etc. Regardless of the entity type the process of migration includes 3 basic steps; download the source, process it and then save it. <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85171208-8d805080-b23c-11ea-8e7a-f5638be0ca3f.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"ETL Process\" /></figure></li>\n<li>Islandora’s <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/migrate_7x_claw\">migrate_7x_claw</a></strong> module is a Drupal 8 Migrate Plus migration that  pulls content directly from an Islandora 7.x Solr/Fedora server.

This app utilizes a CSV file to import the content (objects), the base fields, and can generate new taxonomy terms when configured to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Supports ingesting objects via webforms. This is a basic fundamental functionality of Drupal 8 that Islandora leverages for all types of UI ingests and modification.</li>\n<li>Supports uploading objects via a form and having that object approved and published by another user. This mediated process is done through a standard Drupal concept called an editorial workflow. This process is for an organization that utilizes several workflows such as create, edit, review, and publish and would like to restrict access to those workflows based on roles. A full breakdown of how this is accomplished can be located at Drupal’s Editorial Workflow page (Lakatos &amp; Hodgdon, 2019).</li>\n<li>Supports self and mediated deposit. This process is identical to the previous comments on mediated workflows with the only difference being that for a self published deposit, the user should be granted the corresponding roles needed to accomplish the task.

            "content_html": "<p>Islandora 8’s content modeling is based on ontology with a mix of Drupal’s microservices, context, and action solutions. Islandora objects are referred to as nodes. A node’s type is called a resource model. The resource models include (but are not limited to) audio, binary, collections, digital documents, images, pages, paged content, publication issue, and videos. In Islandora 7, content models refer to how derivatives are generated and how the object is displayed, however in Islandora 8 this concept doesn’t fit the behavior completely. When a model tag is applied to an object/node, this indicates to Drupal which context(s) to use resulting in corresponding actions to be fired. generating appropriate derivatives, resource mapping, and specifying an appropriate default viewer.</p>\n<p>“Islandora 8 Data Model. Between the original capabilities of Drupal 8, the wealth of available modules, and the work that has already been done with Islandora 8, nearly any standard Islandora 7 content model can be represented in Islandora 8 from the simple (binary, PDF, image, audio, video) to the complex (compounds, books, newspapers). This is all done via the Repository Item content model which contains nearly all of the fields necessary to describe any type of object, and is the core of most of Islandora 8’s Drupal features. Many Drupal views and contexts can be triggered by targeting one or more of the fields in a Repository Item node in a way that makes requiring separate content types unnecessary. Examples include changing the template for displaying a node based on what “type” it is, or changing the viewer that is used based on the type of file a node has.” [<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Y7kGyVlrRW3uIqFPzMgQ2nj3gzB3U2FEO75X2n3bo8\">link</a>] </p>\n<ul>\n<li>An object is a <em>node</em> (a.k.a. <em>content</em>).</li>\n<li>Nodes have properties that can be configured called <em>fields</em>.</li>\n<li>Fields for nodes are grouped together as <em>content types</em>.</li>\n<li>Datastreams are <em>media</em>, which are <em>files</em> that can have their own fields and <em>media types</em>.</li>\n<li>Metadata used to categorize entities are <em>taxonomy terms</em>, which also have their own fields and <em>vocabularies</em>.

            "content_html": "<p>Islandora 7 is a monolithic application that glues Drupal 6/7 to Fedora 3 with an optional institutional repository (IR) addon. Islandora 7 had several pain points, such as workflows, most of which required substantial coding to work around these issues. Although Islandora is  a collection of several Drupal 6/7 modules, it wasn’t written in a way that leveraged much of Drupal’s content management functionality. Fortunately the release of Drupal 8 has remedied this.</p>\n<p>The Drupal 8 release in 2015 had a major overhaul of the code base. This meant that upgrading from Drupal 7 into Drupal 8 broke content libraries, functions, and theming. Drupal 8’s migration is an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process as part of its Migrate API. The data can come from a variety of places; a database, CSV, JSON, or REST function, and then transformed, imported, and processed (Migrate API overview, 2019).</p>\n<p>Future upgrades of Drupal versions will look substantially different than before. Gone are the days of major migration planning as Drupal has completely overhauled their application lifecycle. Drupal 9 was released in June 2020 the process of upgrading won’t cause any loss in functionality or any libraries to break; the core is completely backwards compatible. This important feature was adopted  for the new life cycle for all future version releases. It was explained simply by Alex Lopez, “You’ll just get notices advising you to upgrade libraries, function calls, and anything else in your code that would make your module incompatible with a Drupal 10 version. But, theoretically, nothing that would break your module/site.”(2018). A large focus of Drupal core and module development for the 8 release was on specific industries, including but not limited to big data and higher education. “Build a wide range of solutions from university websites, applications, scholarly publishing, and more.” (Drupal for education, 2020).</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85065822-db814f80-b17b-11ea-8eb5-4ee294bae8fb.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"background\" /></figure></p>\n<p>Islandora changed the development approach to align with Drupal 8’s direction. A major focus on Islandora 8 is to build the stack in a way that fully utilizes Drupal 8 and make the contributed modules available. There are so many modules currently  developed and actively managed by other institutions that provide content modeling  and developing metadata has become exceedingly easier. As the need for IRs increases, the number of options available have increased as well making it sometimes difficult to sift through to find the best option for the community. Since these are so new, many of these lack sufficient documentation or guidance on how to best utilize the modules for a digital or institutional repository. The Islandora community makes every effort to bring content models together by research, community vetting, writing documentation, and creating solutions to help provide a ready made (turnkey) solution. Islandora 8 content is now utilizing Drupal nodes as the primary representation instead of how Islandora 7 overwrote Drupal routing to provide an object and it’s content. Islandora 8 content is Drupal content (stored in Fedora 5) and is completely compatible with 3rd party addons. In almost every cases the Islandora content is treated exactly the same as any other content imported into a base Drupal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"extra\">Extra</h3>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://arc-hum.princeton.edu/sites/arc_hum/files/styles/pwds_featured_image/public/news/princeton-logo_1.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Princton Diagram\" /></figure> \nHere’s a technical video on Princeton’s content migration to Drupal 8 </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZJuilHUIVA\" title=\"Drupal 8 &amp; Princeton University\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://image.slidesharecdn.com/princeton-university-press-status-aug2017-camp-drupalnorth-170829182326/95/princeton-university-press-to-drupal-8-migration-case-study-by-evolving-web-18-638.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Drupal 8 &amp; Princeton University\" /></figure></a></p>\n",
