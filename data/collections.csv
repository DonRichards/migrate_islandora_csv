2,1,,Knoxville Garden Slides,"This collection of hand-colored lantern slides dates from the late 1920s and early 1930s. The slides depict ornamental gardens in the Knoxville, Tennessee, area and feature a variety of garden styles, plants, flowers, and foliage. They illustrate the rich tradition of gardening and beautification in Knoxville. Some of the slides are credited to Knoxville photographer, Jim Thompson, and it is possible that he produced all of them. Mrs. A.C. Bruner, an eminent member of the Knoxville Garden Club, donated the collection to the UT Libraries. The Knoxville Garden Club was organized in 1923 and was admitted nine years later to the Garden Club of America. Members of the club not only created and showed their own residential gardens but also worked throughout the Knoxville community to sponsor horticulture programs, host civic plantings, and support many other beautification efforts. In 1955, the club established the Dogwood Trails, which evolved into the Dogwood Arts Festival, an annual celebration of the area's culture and natural beauty that today attracts thousands of visitors.",collections:knoxgardens,https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/collections%3Aknoxgardens/datastream/FEATURED/view/collections_knoxgardens.jpg,collections_knoxgardens.jpg,,Collection,0,https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/collections%3Aknoxgardens/datastream/MODS/view/collections_knoxgardens.xml,https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/collections:knoxgardens/datastream/TN/view/collections_knoxgardens.jpg
3,1,,Postcards from the Great Smoky Mountains,"In the early to mid-twentieth century postcards were an essential component of the travel experience for many visitors to the Great Smoky Mountains. While cameras and photography in general were financially out of reach for some, postcards were a readily accessible medium for sharing travel experiences with others. Before the introduction of color photography, postcards with color images were tinted versions of black and white pictures. They depicted mountain scenes more true to life than did amateur snapshots. As important as the image on the front of the postcard, the reverse captured the personal message of the sender, often an intimate moment in time.

Postcards from The Great Smoky Mountains has been formed by selecting postcards from a variety of manuscript collections, primarily the Ridley Willis Postcard Collection (MS. 3781). The online collection contains souvenir accordion-style folders as well as the fronts and backs of individual postcards. Several prominent photographers, including Jim Thompson and Walter Cline, and Smoky Mountain residents like Jack Huff are represented in the collection. The images document prominent landmarks, geographic features, and man-made improvements such as roads complete with vintage automobiles.",gsmrc:pcard00,https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/gsmrc%3Apcard00/datastream/FEATURED/view/gsmrc_pcard00.jpg,gsmrc_pcard00.jpg,,Collection,0,https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/gsmrc%3Apcard00/datastream/MODS/view/gsmrc_pcard00.xml,https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/gsmrc:pcard00/datastream/TN/view/gsmrc_pcard00.jpg
