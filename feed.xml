                <p>During ingests/migrations there are several items that has been covered by different sections of this document. It helps to have a working knowledge of linked data, RDF, and ontology &amp; vocabulary basics vs repository-specific ontologies to create a comprehensive migration/ingest. Names, files, metadata along with the DOI is important to know how this information should be stored to process it correctly.</p>
<h3 id="batch">Batch</h3>
<p><a href="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#ingesting-files">Ingesting Files</a> according to the documentation the Migrate API is the main way to ingest batches of data into Drupal (and because Islandora 8 is Drupal, into Islandora). The Migrate module only provides the framework, it’s up to you to create the rules that take data from a source, through a process (i.e. a mapping) to a destination. A set of these rules is called a “migration”. It has to be set up (as a Configuration Entity, either by importing a YAML file or by installing a Feature) and then it has to be ran. In a nutshell the steps are the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a CSV file.</li>
<li>Create a yml for each type of entity (person, place, event, university, etc) needing to mint. </li>
<li>Create a “file” yml configuration file for the files.</li>
<li>Create a “media” yml configuration file for the files to specify their media behavior once in Drupal.</li>
<li>Create a “node” yml configuration file for gluing the file and media to a node. It the Islandora 7 terminology this would be the “object”.</li>
</ol>

<p>Althought this process can be done in the admin UI, it’s highly suggested to use drush commands. The UI doesn’t respect order of operations and very little information is given from the admin UI when there is an error.</p>

                <p>Uploading is part of the ingest process but information and modules specific to uploading can be found here. Uploads are not resumable and subject to connectivity issues. If you really want to upload large files, you should consider some alternatives such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Batch Ingest: The standard way of operating is utilizing the CSV import process. This is primarily through a terminal but offers a highly customizable experience allowing for complex metadata and many other features.

<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/uppy">Uppy File Uploader</a> Uses the chunking, resumable, TUS file transfer protocol to upload files. This is a modular open source JavaScript file uploader.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/flysystem">flysystem</a>‘s ftp and sftp plugins to make files available if you can run an FTP server.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/pfs">Private File System</a>: Private File System provides a way to serve files(i.e. static assets) from the Drupal private file system(private://) based on custom restrictions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/file_upload_options">File Upload Options</a>: trivial for the document but useful for technical side of the system. This specifies what should happen when uploaded files have the same name as existing files. Configured per field, the options are are grouped by entity type.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technical-notes">Technical Notes</h3>
<p>If you want to upload large (&gt; 1GB) files, the VM provided by the community has some options not set. You’ll need to tune the following settings in your php.ini:</p>
<ul>
<li>upload_max_filesize – The maximum allowed upload file size.</li>
<li>post_max_size – The maximum allowed POST data size.</li>
<li>max_input_time – Maximum allowed input time.</li>
<li>max_execution_time – The maximum allowed time the scripts are allowed to run.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, large file transfer over HTTP still has a host of issues once you properly configure your server. PHP’s integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit integers, some filesystem functions may return unexpected results for files which are larger than 2GB and could cause <code>filesize</code> to report the UI an incurrate reading. It won’t cause functions to fail just to not report correctly. This is a reported flaw within <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filesize.php">PHP</a>. </p>

<p>The simpliest way to implement a highly customizable submit, review, accept, publish workflow is to leverage Drupal’s Content Moderation. Most of the needed steps have already be accomplished by existing modules and workflows. Once the content has been reviewed it can be passed as a node and several aditional actions can be fired at this or and other stage of the submissions/publish process.</p>
<h3 id="needed-modules">Needed Modules</h3>
<p>★ Drupal’s Core Module Content Moderation</p>
<h3 id="user-groups">User groups</h3>
<p>Create some user roles (admin &gt; people &gt; roles). For this example the following roles would be useful to add.</p>
<ul>
<li>Student</li>
<li>Thesis Manager</li>
<li>Dissertation Manager</li>
</ul>
<p>We will set thier permissions later but for now create a user for each of these and add the corresponding roles. </p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85894536-eadb4b00-b7c2-11ea-86e5-fd7b0b825b59.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="users and roles" /></figure></p>
<h3 id="special-permissions-considerations">Special Permissions Considerations</h3>
<p>Repository content should not be immediately accessible to the public. The Drupal 8 module <em>permissions_by_term</em> and the sub-module <em>permissions_by_entity</em> allows us to create a ‘ETD-submission’ term that, when applied to nodes and media will restrict access to them (and files as an extension of media) to permission group members.</p>
<p>However, access to files will only be checked if they are in a managed filesystem such as the Drupal private filesystem or one provided by a Flysystem adapter (like the Fedora Adapter provided by Islandora 8). When Islandora 8 creates derivate media it places them in the public filesystem by default. This is generally a good idea because it is more performant than other filesystems but then derivatives of restricted items become publicly accessible, which is not what we want. A repository manager can change the derivative actions to save them into either the private of Fedora filesystems, but this comes at a performance cost when accessing files that are publicly accessible.</p>
<p>Enter <em>file_access_fix</em>. This handy module will check an entity (node, media, etc.) on update to see if it has any referenced files. If so, it will check if the entity is available by Anonymous users and will move the file to the appropriate filesystem, either public or private, based on it’s availability. So, if I create a derivative that is saved in the private filesystem by default, this module will check to see if the media is publicly accessible, if so, it will move it to the more performant public filesystem for me! If I ever decide that the media actually should be restricted, the module will move the file from the public filesystem back to the private one. See more on <a href="https://seth-shaw-unlv.github.io/2020-06-23/permissions_by_term_file_access_fix">Permissions By Entity &amp; File Access Fix</a></p>
<h3 id="create-custom-types">Create Custom types</h3>
<p>Create Custom “Thesis, Dissertation, and Supplemental” <strong>media</strong> types and “Thesis, Dissertation” <strong>content</strong> types. Create the media types first. </p>
<h4 id="create-media-types">Create Media Types</h4>
<p>The Media Types list should now include Supplimental, Thesis and Dissertation (Admin &gt; Structure &gt; Media Types)</p>
<p>Since objects in Islandora 8 are stored in Drupal as Nodes, we use the standard Drupal Content Types system to create and edit our ‘ingest forms’ <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/administering-drupal-8-site/managing-content-0/working-with-content-types-and-fields">Content Types in Drupal 8</a>. Islandora 8 forms are Drupal forms, and if you are already familiar with Drupal Field UI, you’re already well equipped to create and modify your own ingest forms in Islandora 8.</p>
<p>Highly recomended that you follow the <a href="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/content_types/#create-a-content-type">Islandora documentation</a> instructions. </p>

<h3 id="google-scholar-indexing">Google Scholar Indexing</h3>
<p>Google Scholar has many requirements and a few alternatives to those requirements. Mainly the content hosted on your website must consist primarily of scholarly articles - journal papers, conference papers, technical reports, or their drafts, dissertations, pre-prints, post-prints, or abstracts. Content such as news or magazine articles, book reviews, and editorials is not appropriate for Google Scholar. Content must make either the full text of the articles or their complete author-written abstracts freely available above the fold. There are several other restrictions that can be found at <a href="https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#overview">Google Scholar Inclusion Guidelines</a></p>
<h4 id="metatag-google-scholar"><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag_google_scholar">Metatag Google Scholar</a></h4>
<p>Currently the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag_google_scholar">Metatag Google Scholar</a> along with the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag">metatag</a> modules adds the following <em>Highwire Press</em> tags:</p>
<ul>
<li>citation_title</li>
<li>citation_author</li>
<li>citation_publication_date</li>
<li>citation_journal_title</li>
<li>citation_issn</li>
<li>citation_isbn</li>
<li>citation_volume</li>
<li>citation_issue</li>
<li>citation_firstpage</li>
<li>citation_lastpage</li>
<li>citation_dissertation_institution</li>
<li>citation_technical_report_institution</li>
<li>citation_technical_report_number</li>
<li>citation_pdf_url</li>
</ul>

&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_pdf_url&quot; content=&quot;http://www.example.com/content/271/20/11761.full.pdf&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The title tag, e.g., citation_title or DC.title, must contain the title of the paper. Don’t use it for the title of the journal or a book in which the paper was published, or for the name of your repository. This tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>
<p>The author tag, e.g., citation_author or DC.creator, must contain the authors (and only the actual authors) of the paper. Don’t use it for the author of the website or for contributors other than authors, e.g., thesis advisors. Author names can be listed either as “Smith, John” or as “John Smith”. Put each author name in a separate tag and omit all affiliations, degrees, certifications, etc., from this field. At least one author tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>
<p>The publication date tag, e.g., citation_publication_date or DC.issued, must contain the date of publication, i.e., the date that would normally be cited in references to this paper from other papers. Don’t use it for the date of entry into the repository - that should go into citation_online_date instead. Provide full dates in the “2010/5/12” format if available; or a year alone otherwise. This tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>
<p>For journal and conference papers, provide the remaining bibliographic citation data in the following tags: citation_journal_title or citation_conference_title, citation_issn, citation_isbn, citation_volume, citation_issue, citation_firstpage, and citation_lastpage. Dublin Core equivalents are DC.relation.ispartof for journal and conference titles and the non-standard tags DC.citation.volume, DC.citation.issue, DC.citation.spage (start page), and DC.citation.epage (end page) for the remaining fields. Regardless of the scheme chosen, these fields must contain sufficient information to identify a reference to this paper from another document, which is normally all of: (a) journal or conference name, (b) volume and issue numbers, if applicable, and (c) the number of the first page of the paper in the volume (or issue) in question.</p>
<p>For theses, dissertations, and technical reports, provide the remaining bibliographic citation data in the following tags: citation_dissertation_institution, citation_technical_report_institution or DC.publisher for the name of the institution and citation_technical_report_number for the number of the technical report. As with journal and conference papers, you need to provide sufficient information to recognize a formal citation to this document from another article.</p>
<p>For all document types, the guiding principle is to present your article as it would normally be cited in the “References” section of another paper. E.g., citations to technical reports normally include their assigned numbers, so the number of the report should be present in some appropriate field. Likewise, the name of the journal should be written as “Transactions on Magic Realism” or “Trans. Mag. Real.”, not as “Magic Realism, Transactions on” or “T12”. Omission or unusual presentation of key bibliographic fields can lead to mis-identification of your articles.</p>
<p>All tag values are HTML attributes, so you must escape special characters appropriately. E.g., <meta name="citation_title" content="&quot;Andar com meus sapatos&quot; - uma an&#225;lise cr&#237;tica">. There’s no need to escape characters that are written directly in your webpage’s character encoding, such as Latin diacritics on a page in ISO-8859-1. However, you must still escape the quotes and the angle brackets.</p>
<p>The “<meta>“ tags normally apply only to the exact page on which they’re provided. If this page shows only the abstract of the paper and you have the full text in a separate file, e.g., in the PDF format, please specify the locations of all full text versions using citation_pdf_url or DC.identifier tags.

</blockquote>
<p>Although not common I can’t seem to locate a ready made solution for uploading content from Drupal 8 into Google Book Search’s API. It’s unknown how long this would take and it’s unlikely to be nessisary based on the sizes of the current dissertations currently being hosted in Bepress.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p><a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF</a> (International Image Interoperability Framework) is a set of specifications that provides interoperability of image-based collections across platforms. What this means for a repository platform like Islandora at a general level is that image-based objects such as (still) images and paged content can be managed by Islandora but viewed in external applications, and that Islandora can bring in image-based content from elsewhere to supplement locally managed content. If this intrigues you, see the section “Looking under the hood (and beyond)” below.</p>
<p>At a practial level, because Islandora supports several of the IIIF specifications, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom, pan, and rotate images within OpenSeadragon</li>
<li>Islandora uses an IIIF-compliant image server (by default, <a href="https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/">Cantaloupe</a>) that utilizes the IIIF Image API. This capablity is similar to what Islandora 7.x users experience when they view a Large Image.</li>
<li>Display thumbnails for all pages of a book or newspaper issue within image viewers</li>
<li>IIIF-compliant image viewers such as OpenSeadragon or Mirador can display a “collection” of images such as all the pages of a book or newspaper issue using the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/">IIIF Presentation API</a>. For example, here is a screenshot of OpenSeadragon rendering all the pages of a book: <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/osd_collection_mode.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="pages of a book" /></figure></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-iiif-in-islandora-8">Using IIIF in Islandora 8</h3>
<p>Implementation of the IIIF Presentation API is new in Islandora 8, and using it is as simple as configuring a Context (in fact, you don’t even need to configure it; the Context, Openseadragon Block, already exists by default). To use this Context, all that is required is for your book or newspaper (or other paged content) to be given a model of “Paged Content” or “Publication Issue”. Then, in the Openseadragon Block Context, make sure the term used in the “Node has term” condition (you can register more than one term there). Now, when you view a paged content Islandora object, you will see thumbnails of all of its child pages (assuming you have added some child pages to the object) in the OpenSeadragon viewer as illustrated above.</p>
<p>To view an object’s <strong>manifest</strong> navigate to the node’s URL and add <code>/manifest</code></p>
<p>Example: <code>http://myrepo.edu/node/23/manifest</code></p>
<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>
<p>IIIF-compliant viewers don’t need to be embedded in Islandora websites. If a viewer on another website knows the URL of a IIIF manifest like the ones that Islandora can produce, that viewer can display the content described in the manifest. Here’s an example of how a viewer can display from multiple external domains with just a manifest.

<li><a href="https://www.library.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a> Drupal 7.x &amp; 8.x</li>
</ol>
<p>With the release of Drupal 8 several universities, venders and volunteers have created and contributed to Drupal module solutions to meet acedemic needs. Here is a list of a few Institutional Repository (IR) &amp; Research Data Management (RDM) related modules currently available for Drupal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Scholar: Google Scholar(GS) provides a simple way to broadly search for scholarly literature. From one place, you can search across many disciplines and sources: articles, theses, books, abstracts and court opinions, from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities and other web sites. Google Scholar helps you find relevant work across the world of scholarly research. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/project-images/about_scholar.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="gs logo" /></figure></li>

<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/seo_checklist">SEO Checklist</a> GS indexing crawlers rely on Googlebot to index a site. All of the typical Google crawler requirements need to be met for GS to index a site. That’s what makes a module like this critical.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/linked_data_field">Linked Data Lookup Field</a>: Supports Library of Congress Subject Headings, Global Research Identifier Database (GRID) entries, and CrossRef Funder identifiers and autocompletes the values out of the box. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/project-images/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-30%20at%202.22.31%20PM_0.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Linked Data Lookup Field screenshot" /></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers">Persistent Identifiers</a>: for minting and persisting persistent identifiers (Handles, DOIs, ARKs, etc.). <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers/raw/master/docs/images/mint_checkbox.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="mint screenshot" /></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/orcid">ORCID</a>: ORCID integration and allowing users to login with ORCID credentials</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/user_progress">User Progress API</a>: The User progress API module was sponsored by the Pennsylvania State University. It has been developed for charting students’ progression throughout a system.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/workflows/overview">Drupal Workflows</a> is a core Drupal feature and is well documented. This was complicated in Drupal 7/Islandora 7 but now this process is trivial and is built into Drupal 8.</p>

<p>This system created a Drupal content type that represents a research data management plan.  DMPRoadMap is software used by DMPTool in the US, DMPOnline in Europe. In Canada, the DMP Assistant in Canada is moving towards that framework. The draft Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy highlights the importance of DMPs as a best practices in research data management and this feature provides researchers with a tool to help them meet emerging funding requirements. This content type models a generic funder template and associated guidance modeled on the DMPRoadMap. It is possible to have Conditional fields to provide specific funder templates.</p>
<p>This module directly integrates ORCID oauth login relating their user profile with thier ORCID ID and giving them the ability to link thier submitted content with ORCID.

<li>Anonymous users</li>
<li>Submitter: authenticated user; can submit items (objects) to one or more collections</li>
<li>Collection administrator/Editor - can add/remove submitters to a collection; can approve and publish / reject submissions; can edit item metadata; can withdraw items from public view; can deligate reviewers to submissions through roles.</li>
<li>Reviewer - can view an item not yet published and provide comments to Collection administrator/Editor.</li>
<li>Repository administrator - can perform all functions of the collection administrator for the

<li>Ability for submitters to upload objects into the system and have that item published by a user with another role and was covered by a previous requirement.<ol start="6">
<li>Ability to create a metadata only record that refers to an externally hosted object. Depending on the type of content this is mostly built into Drupal core code. When creating a <code>media</code> object this is basically what happens. The next step of either pointing to a local file or a remote resource is fiarly common with content management systems. </li>
<li>Generates persistent document identification (DOI) for creating permanent links to individual records (CNRI Handles, DOIs). Minting DOIs has been accomplished with the <a href="https://github.com/roblib/islandora_rdm/tree/8.x-1.x/islandora_rdm_datacite_doi">Islandora Research Data Management Platform</a> repository for datacite DOIs.

                <p>Drupal is a very popular and well-known CMS for educational websites. And it’s very important that Drupal has tools to deal with bibliography and citations. </p>
<h3 id="bibliography--citation-bibcite">Bibliography &amp; Citation (BibCite)</h3>
<p>The Bibliography &amp; Citation project (aka <strong><a href="https://www.drupal.org/case-study/bibliography-and-citation-module-for-drupal-8">BibCite</a></strong>) is a Drupal contributed module that helps to organize and save bibliographic data about the content ranging from web pages to books and scientific research works. The module gives a field to export a citation of sources according to thousands of standards that have been accepted at different times in different organizations. </p>
<p>BibCite provides an API for bibliographic citations rendering. CSL styles are used for rendering. It also provides the administration UI which allows to choose a processor (currently only citeproc PHP is available) and to choose global CSL style.</p>
<p>You can also manage CSL styles from the administration UI - you can edit or delete a predefined style or install a new style manually or from .csl or xml files.

<ul>
<li><strong>Bibliography &amp; Citation</strong>: It is a core module that provides API for a render of bibliography citation. The library we used is from official CSL style repository with over 8000 styles. Those styles are available without charge under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (BY-SA) license.</li>
<li><strong>Entity</strong>: Implements storage for bibliography data as Drupal entities: bibliography, contributor and keyword. Bibliography entity can be rendered as citations, exported and imported.</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong>: Provides the possibility to export bibliography content. Adds export links to citations (configurable)</li>
<li><strong>Import</strong>: Provides import feature and UI for import from files.</li>
<li><strong>BibTeX</strong>: Provides possibility to use BibTeX format for import and export.</li>
<li><strong>Endnote</strong>: Provides possibility to use EndNote 7 XML, EndNote X3 XML and EndNote Tagged formats for import and export.</li>
<li><strong>Marc</strong>: Provides possibility to use MARC format for import and export.</li>
<li><strong>RIS</strong>: Provides possibility to use RIS format for import and export.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers">Persistent Identifiers</a>: Module for minting and persisting persistent identifiers (Handles, DOIs, ARKs, etc.). </p>
<pre><code class="language-text">  Persistent identifiers can be minted by a variety of sources, such as CrossRef, DataCite, or EZID. Regardless of the specific source, many of the tasks involved in assigning persistent identifiers to Drupal nodes are the same - providing a &quot;Mint Identifier&quot; button in a node edit form, integration into automated workflows, or persisting identifiers to fields on an entity.

  This module provides some common tasks while allowing small amounts of code (specifically Drupal services) to handle the particulars of minting and persisting. In addition, a Drupal site admin might want to mix and match minting and persisting services. Generally speaking, this module&#39;s goal is to allow site admins to select the minters and persisters they want, while helpin developers to write as little code as necessary to create new minter and persister services.</code></pre>

<li>In May 2020 the Islandora Foundation announced they joined the Drupal Association as part of their Supporting Partner Program. [<a href="https://islandora.ca/content/islandora-foundation-joins-drupal-association">link</a>] The Drupal Association is an educational non-profit organization that tasks itself with fostering and supporting the Drupal software project, the community and its growth.

<li>Islandora utilizes multiple technologies for community involvement including but not limited to<ol>
<li>Slack Chat</li>
<li>Zoom Chat</li>
<li>IRC (infrequently used)</li>
<li>Email/phone</li>
<li>Github issues/Pull requests</li>
<li>JIRA ticketing</li>
<li>Drupal Gitlabs</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Islandora has several Interest groups and collaboration groups that work regularly on community projects. A recent example of this was the survey and development of the Institutional repository Delta document. Although a IR repository is possible to assemble without a dedicated module it wouldn’t be a standardized process making community assistance a challenge. With help from the Google Scholar engineering team, the community developed with the help with feedback from the community drafted a document proposing an “Islandora Scholar” module that would bring together all the needed resources for a “turnkey” IR solution. Several options were left out deliberately that weren’t essential and could easily be accomplished with few steps from a tutorial. The Islandora interest group surveyed the community, reviewed existing IR options, and consulted with leading industry engineers. Creating a plan for a solution that meets the community’s needs and to precisely align the content in accordance with the Google Scholar engineering team’s feedback. Islandora has years of experience developing an institutional repository, originally developed in 2012 and the community is well equipped to handle the challenge of developing a solution that meets the community’s needs.</li>
<li>Vendors are constantly participating and contributing to the progression of the Islandora community and stack. They participate at a nearly daily occurance and provide a lot of assistance to community.</li>
<li>The onboarding process is well established with frequent workshops, video tutorials, 1-on-1 assistance from community members through zoom, and chat options. This makes the stack highly approachable to small colleges and large universities alike.</li>
<li>The Islandora community is a self-sustaining community of over 300 universities and an unknown number of private institutions, it’s clear that the community is well established.</li>
<li>With the platform mainly a “turnkey” repository option providing small and large repositories alike a relatively standardized solution with the flexibility of future growth built in.</li>
<li>The community has gravitated towards providing the options for the users to implement the latest information technology standards, iteratively improve the quality of the platform and inclusivity for the community to meet all of their needs for a repository. </li>
<li>The community engaged pedagogy embraces co-learning and is rooted in a respect for the prior knowledge and experiences that community partners bring to the conversation.</li>
<li>Expert discovery efforts (identifying improvements and developing solutions).</li>
<li>New efforts integrate the community into a broader community with Drupal. This means automated code review for security issues from Drupal, code hosting is hosted directly on Drupal’s gitlab servers. Having all of Islandora and its contrib modules on Drupal means the update feature in the UI will recognize the modules and allow for module conflict avoidence and update integrations.</li>

                <p>For self hosted soltutions there are 2 basic deployment options; Ansible(a style we’re currently using) or deploying through Docker images.</p>
<ol>
<li>Islandora’s <a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook">Ansible playbook</a> comes with 2 preconfigured operating system defaults; Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS/7. The deployment can be configured for a local VM or a production deployment. “Ansible is the simplest solution for configuration management available. It’s designed to be minimal in nature, consistent, secure and highly reliable, with an extremely low learning curve for administrators, developers and IT managers.” - [<a href="https://www.ansible.com/use-cases/configuration-management">link</a>]</li>
<li>ISLE Project facilitating creation and management of Islandora 8 Infrastructure with Docker (containerized server). This is bleeding edge technology for deployment. This would require some infrastructure and training to prepare our staff for this option. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85332417-e999dd80-b4a5-11ea-9aa2-8d1a14f8655e.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="isle_prototype" /></figure><ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>The stack can also be a standard manual development and deployment. Although there is nothing technically wrong with this option, it is generally considered time comsuming to initially setup and generally considered realatively unnessisary. This has historically been Digital Initiative’s pattern of operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these options can utilize a continous development (automated deployment) life cycle. </p>

<li>Drupal 8 completely supports CAS authentication [<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/cas">link</a>].</li>
<li>Islandora 8 provides several different reports out-of-the-box. From microservice stats to usage stats. There are several options and are highly configurable. Here is an example of Mark Jordan’s module that provides a collection of graphical reports on various aspects of an Islandora repository. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_repository_reports/raw/master/docs/images/random_pie.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="pie chart" /></figure> <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_repository_reports/raw/master/docs/images/random_bar.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="bar chart" /></figure></li>
<li>“Supports logging of manual dashboard processes by authenticated users” <strong>I am uncertain as to what this is referring to at this time.</strong></li>
<li>Like any other web servers, Islandora 8 can be hosted locally. The biggest benefits are leveraging the power of CPU multithreading and large memory size utilization are the most cost effective. However, self hosted hardware costs money to maintain and upgrade. Please see <a href="cloud-hosting-solution.html">Cloud Hosting</a> for other options.</li>
<li>Another option is using a cloud hosted provider like any one of the numerous options Amazon’s cloud hosting provides. Again please see <a href="cloud-hosting-solution.html">Cloud Hosting</a> for cloud options.</li>
<li>Another option to include is a decoupled headless version. This solution was recently demonstrated by Discovery Gardens. It allows for all of the management side of development to be done on the Drupal server but the frontend to be a Reactjs solution. This improves speed and allows a much more flexible frontend solution to be applied. This would allow us to develop the entire site’s frontend behavior to be implemented the same way we’ve created the digital collection’s landing page. </li>
<li>The bare minimum to run Islandora 8 in a virtual machine (for development) is 1 CPU core with 4GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. A more comprehensive specification needs to consider applications in the stack with large needs for scalability. “Cantaloupe uses a thread-per-request model, and maintains its own thread pool to carry out certain tasks asynchronously and spread work across processors. Response times will benefit from multiple fast cores.” (Deployment, 2020) Blazegraph has a few complicated tradeoffs for RAM vs harddrive performance for ideal implementations. The configuration they suggest is a 4 core (3.5GHz) system with 16GB RAM on a pair of SSDs. For 1 billion RDF triple is 83.8GB of storage/32GB if in RAM (Bebee, 2020). In conclusion for the infrastructure, the system depends on the desired scalability and performance expected. This is a full content management system with several high performance applications.</li>

<li>Rightsstatements.org is not specifically discussed in the documentation. Although extensive URI integration for controlled access terms is documented on the site, an assessment by the metadata librarian would give a clearer picture. I brought this up to the community and they suggested this would be a simple module. There are a few options to achieve this but there is no “turnkey” module ready for this at this time.</li>
<li>Drupal is the gatekeeper for access management. Although Fedora offers WebAC access control as a solution to regulate access to Fedora resources, it was determined not to be granular enough for most of the Islandora community. WebAC only offers 4 types of access (read, write, append, and control) lack the granularity of group roles and conditional states. Drupal’s access management is far more rebust and is easier to configure. Restricting access by collection, object/node, datastreams, etc. is all managed within the Drupal UI and does not require any programming or aditional modules. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85619317-1974ec80-b630-11ea-9a56-191a20d721ab.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Permissions Screenshot" /></figure> <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue41/vanbergen/vanbergen_ill_3.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Conditional relationship and access action model" /></figure></li>

<li>A few solutions are available for vendors to host a solution for a fee.</li>
<li>Able to run the stack on a cloud hosting provider like Amazon’s AWS. The demo is running on EC2 and Lightsail (an Amazon cloud solution).<ol>
<li>Price modeling on any AWS solution is complicated and varies greatly by size and frequency of use. The task of summarizing AWS option pricing could be its own project. “In 2020, AWS comprised more than 212 services including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things.” [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">link</a>] </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A few options specifically beneficial to cloud hosting include load balancing VM cluster servers (multiple identical servers) and a simple snapshot process for backing up. These can be achieved in hardware, they would require some expensive investments. Cloud hosting also makes hosting hardware unnecessary. An additional note is that some functions can be automated for either solution like scheduled backups, automated application deployment, and system monitoring. There is absolutely no mitigation of fully automated systems and application maintenance and most cloud solutions cost are prohibitively high when scaling to high numbers of CPU cores or large amounts of RAM.</li>
<li>A few vendors are available like Discovery Garden and Born Digital offering several options; anything from migration consultation, to migrating content from 7 to 8, develop a Islandora 8 solution that meets the institution’s needs, Islandora-as-a-service and several other options. </li>

<li>Oxford Common File Layout Specification (OCFL) is coming next year with the release of Fedora 6.x according to Danny Lamb and David Wilcox. This should be available within Islandora as part of upgrading Fedora to 6.x. <blockquote>
<p>The previously mentioned disadvantages of the Fedora API may be mitigated by a relatedcommunity initiative called the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL). The OCFL is acommunity-based effort to develop “an application-independent approach to the storage ofdigital information in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed topromote long-term object management best practices within digital repositories.” The originalidea for this effort came from a Fedora Camp hosted at the University of Oxford in September2017, so it has roots in the Fedora community even though the OCFL is not dependent onFedora in any way. However, if Fedora were to store repository resources as specified by theOCFL, major upgrades in the future may become much easier. One of the primary motivatinguse cases of the OCFL is to reduce the need for data migrations; both because moving largeamounts of data is time-consuming and because such migrations risk data corruption and loss.The OCFL decouples the structure of files on disk from the application(s) that manage the filesby defining a file and folder hierarchy to which applications must conform. Thus, the files can beleft in place and new software applications can implement the OCFL specification in order tomanage the files. - [<a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/download/attachments/131533003/Designing%20a%20Migration%20Path%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf">link</a>]</p>

Scan the website’s rendered content for images with missing or blank alt text attributes. Flag those images using Taxonomy Terms and move them through an administrative workflow in a custom Views page. Look at the actual image flagged for remediation and quickly add missing alt text. All images are labeled with a role attribute of presentation until the alt text is added. If the image should not have alt text, then permanently change the image record to only be for presentation, which will effectively hide it from screen readers.</li>

<li>RDF Mapping; “In Islandora, the JSON-LD Module transforms nodes (or media, or taxonomy terms) into the RDF that is synced into Fedora and the Triplestore. It uses RDF mappings, a concept defined by the RDF Module, and exposes them through the REST API” (RDF Generation, n.d.).  <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85457087-a014c580-b56d-11ea-843d-780d6b13cd27.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Mapping" /></figure><ol start="2">
<li>“The RDF Module is part of Drupal Core, but has no official documentation. The RDF Module embeds RDFa, a form of linked data, within the Drupal-generated HTML when you load the web page for a node, media, or taxonomy term. Official line is that this will allow Google to provide “rich snippets” such as star-ratings, contact info, and business hours.” [<a href="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/islandora/rdf-mapping/">link</a>]</li>
<li>A custom module rdfui exists, and is installed-but-not-enabled on boxes provisioned by the islandora-playbook. We don’t use it because it is very rudimentary and limited to the schema.org vocabulary. </li>
<li>URI Mapping with persistent identifiers. With access to an API for minting persistent identifiers (e.g., DataCite, EZID, etc.).  <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers/raw/master/docs/images/mint_checkbox.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="mint persistent_identifiers" /></figure> [<a href="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers">link</a>]</li>
<li>The Dupal Schema.org Dataset module recently updated to extend the schema.org metatag module to support schema.org dataset spec. “DOI minting is part of UPEI’s publication workflow, where the system only registers the dataset with Datacite when a curator user ‘publishes’ the dataset, making it public. At that point it sends an XML version of the node fields content to Dataset’s API” [paraphrased from Alexander O’Neill from UPEI via slack chat] <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/04/23/digital-object-identifiers-stability-for-citations/"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogsmedia.lse.ac.uk/blogs.dir/9/files/2015/04/doi.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="DOI breakdown" /></figure></a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/schema_dataset">Schema.org Dataset</a> This module extends Schema.org Metatag module to display structured data representing datasets as JSON-LD in the head of web pages.</li>
<li>Migrating metadata (even complex metadata) is a simple process. In controlled_access_terms, we have an understanding of a typed_relation, which is an entity reference coupled with a MARC relator. The migration script expects an associative array that looks like this: <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85176275-7430d180-b247-11ea-9841-a5086a7ea3f7.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="associative_array" /></figure></li>
</ol>
<p>This is an example of the JSON output for an imported value. To see any entity’s json value add <code>_?_format=json_</code> at the end of the URL of the entity. <code>_jsonld_</code> will work as well to get the jsonld values as well. Example, <em><a href="http://localhost:8000/taxonomy/term/339?_format=json">http://localhost:8000/taxonomy/term/339?_format=json</a></em> 
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85176333-99bddb00-b247-11ea-8ac7-77573747ae3f.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="example_json" /></figure></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Although not absolutely essential it is my understanding that taxonomy vocabulary to categorized metadata should be migrated as entities first before the Islandora 7 objects and their metadata. Generating taxonomy from within a node’s migration is limited. For instance, a Subject’s authority has a title, associated authority and a URI. Automatically generating the subject from within the node migration limits to only the title. Whereas a separate migration allows for all 3 fields to be imported and referenced. Here is the list of taxonomy vocabulary list of “_categories_” of metadata.<ol>
<li><strong>Corporate Body,</strong> an organization or group of persons that is identified by a particular name</li>
<li><strong>Family,</strong> two or more who present themselves as a family</li>
<li><strong>Genre</strong>,  a category characterizing a particular style</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Location</strong>, Geographic area</li>
<li><strong>Islandora access</strong>, Terms used to limit, restrict or coordinate access</li>
<li><strong>Person</strong>, an individual of the human species.</li>
<li><strong>Subject</strong>, topics, events, people, and organizations.</li>
</ol>

                <ol>
<li>Supports migration of objects and their associated datastreams from the Fedora 3 instance to Islandora 8. There are a couple of prebuilt solutions including a process that utilizes a Solr query and preconfigured mappings to achieve a full migration. Another technique utilizes the Drupal 8 module “Migrate Islandora CSV” (Lamb, 2019). As the title suggests this module utilizes a CSV file to migrate and can be generated via the Islandora 7x module “Islandora Get CSV” (Jordan, 2020).  </li>
<li>Islandora has a few options for migrating from Islandora 7. There are 2 core migration options that Islandora supports directly; Islandora CSV migration and the migrate 7x claw (a fedora to fedora option). Another option developed was the Islandora workbench.<ul>
<li>Islandora CSV is the preferred option for it’s simplicity. All of the migration processes in this option are both iterable and reversible. If changes need to be made to the object or it’s metadata the changes can be either updated or rolled back. This is an extremely important feature. This allows for the migration of collections of objects to be migrated with only minimal mappings (if needed). This means all RDF mapping doesn’t have to be complete to migrate the entire collection. RDF is not a flat MODS file that references some URIs. This is a problem with MODS. If a URI was to change, every MODS file must be updated to reflect the new destination. In RDF, the URI is stored and referenced as an entity and not statically in a metadata file. It’s ideal to separate out any value that will be an entity; a subject, person, place, corporation, event, etc. Regardless of the entity type the process of migration includes 3 basic steps; download the source, process it and then save it. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85171208-8d805080-b23c-11ea-8e7a-f5638be0ca3f.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="ETL Process" /></figure></li>
<li>Islandora’s <strong><a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/migrate_7x_claw">migrate_7x_claw</a></strong> module is a Drupal 8 Migrate Plus migration that  pulls content directly from an Islandora 7.x Solr/Fedora server. This module assumes all PIDs are indexed in Solr.<pre><code>       - Currently, the following content models can be migrated over with full functionality:
           * Collection
           * Basic Image
           * Large Image
           * Audio
           * Video
           * PDF
           * Binary</code></pre></li>
<li>Islandora 8 supports batch ingest of objects through the Islandora Workbench repository (Jordan, 2020). This app utilizes a CSV file to import the content (objects), the base fields, and can generate new taxonomy terms when configured to do so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supports ingesting objects via webforms. This is a basic fundamental functionality of Drupal 8 that Islandora leverages for all types of UI ingests and modification.</li>
<li>Supports uploading objects via a form and having that object approved and published by another user. This mediated process is done through a standard Drupal concept called an editorial workflow. This process is for an organization that utilizes several workflows such as create, edit, review, and publish and would like to restrict access to those workflows based on roles. A full breakdown of how this is accomplished can be located at Drupal’s Editorial Workflow page (Lakatos &amp; Hodgdon, 2019).</li>
<li>Supports self and mediated deposit. This process is identical to the previous comments on mediated workflows with the only difference being that for a self published deposit, the user should be granted the corresponding roles needed to accomplish the task. Please see <a href="step-by-step-setup-ir.html">Step by Step Setup of Islandora 8 Scholar</a> for more information on how to set it up. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85894536-eadb4b00-b7c2-11ea-86e5-fd7b0b825b59.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Islandora 8 Scholar Screenshots" /></figure></li>
<li>Supports uploading any binary file type. Islandora 8 treats all repository items as a binary content type. Binary files are treated the same as any other content type, a model tag is applied to an object/node indicating to Drupal which context(s) to use resulting in corresponding actions to be fired.</li>

                <p>Drupal 8 allows for the content types to be added quickly through the admin console. Acceptable file formats, microservice behavior and ontology can all be assigned  through the creation of a custon contenttype.</p>
<ol>
<li>Supports deposit and organization of existing objects into “compound” objects through Drupal’s contributed module Webforms. The manner in which Islandora 8 processes all repository objects is similar to Islandora 7 ingesting a binary cmodel object with a Full MODS form. Examples of “compound” objects are objects from the Postcards from the Great Smoky Mountains &amp; Virginia P. Moore Scrap Book collections.</li>
<li>Supports the deposit and presentation of PDF objects. PDFs with written text can be utilized to provide searching capabilities on the content of a book or document. Ghostscript can be used on text based PDFs. Images require an OCR utility like Tesseract to extract text. This is built into the default Islandora configuration.</li>
<li>Supports the deposit and presentation of audio objects. Most of the functionality specific to audio is carried out by Drupal modules. Audio transcript editing/display, playback, and thumbnail generation of the audio’s waveform are all Drupal core and contributed features.</li>
<li>Supports the deposit and presentation of video objects. Most of the functionality specific to video is carried out by Drupal modules. Video transcript editing/display, thumbnail generation and playback are all Drupal core and contributed features. An Islandora 8 code submission is pending approval for transcripts (Manimjs_drupal, 2020) and an oral history step by step instruction as proof of concept is available (Shaw, 2019).</li>
<li>Supports the deposit and presentation of oral history objects. The only discernible difference between audio/video objects and oral history objects is the presence of transcripts. Transcripts are already part of the audio/video features indicating this is completely covered as well. </li>

                <p>A suite of microservices (Crayfish) are initiated during the process of ingesting an object, which maps resources to Fedora and generates derivative files among other things. Unlike previous versions of Islandora, version 8 asynchronously manages and queues these microservices for scalability, stability, and speed. Specifically some of these microservices generate derivatives like thumbnails, browser sized images, and OCR. The system defaults come with OpenSeadragon with an IIIF image server. The viewer can be switched to Mirador or Universal Viewer with a relatively small amount of code (Zoller, 2019).</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85142859-f5bc3b80-b216-11ea-970a-86c91f02a527.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="mirador_example" /></figure></p>
<ol>
<li>Supports the deposit and characterization of preservation-quality large image (TIFs &amp; JP2s). This process creates derivatives including but not limited to technical metadata generation and other access media for browser consumption.</li>
<li>Supports the deposit of books with preservation-quality large images as pages. Most objects in Islandora are treated like paged objects to begin with so there is little difference between a page versus a large image. The difference is the microservices that are triggered and how that changes the behavior of the viewer.</li>
<li>Automates the generation of access copies and other derivatives when an object is ingested and/or modified. This includes but is not limited to lower resolution media for browsers and thumbnail image generation for small &amp; large images, video and audio files (Waveform generation from original audio file for thumbnail generation).</li>
<li>Serves high quality access derivatives with image-zooming capability via a viewer (OpenSeaDragon, Mirador, or Universal Viewer). The default image viewer is Open Seadragon. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85144983-e8ed1700-b219-11ea-8cec-6558ff985901.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="seadragon-zoomed" /></figure></li>
<li>Renders images with a IIIF image server.</li>
<li>Automating the generation of the OCR microform is taken care of through Hypercube/Tesseract microservice. Tesseract is fully capable but it’s unclear how to configure Drupal to export hOCR. This may be user error and not a limitation of the stack.</li>
<li>Allows for bulk uploads from the admin console. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85143458-c659fe80-b217-11ea-90dd-f6f583c4c30e.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="bulk uploader" /></figure></li>

<li>Islandora 8 is a “complete integration between Drupal resources and a datastore, to manage RDF conversion and asset storage” (Summary, n.d.). Islandora 8 can be configured to use a variety of datastores but it defaults to Duraspace’s Fedora 5.x Repository. Islandora 8.x-1.x makes use of the Portland Common Data Model (PCDM) as a layer of abstraction over LDPCs to make containment simpler to understand for users; a <em>pcdm:Collection</em> may contain other <em>pcdm:Collections</em> or <em>pcdm:Objects</em> (similar to an Islandora 7.x-1.x collection content model), and a <em>pcdm:Object</em> may contain other <em>pcdm:Objects</em> (similar to the way an Islandora 7.x-1.x compound object has child objects) or <em>pcdm:Files</em> (similar to the way Islandora 7.x-1.x objects have datastreams). (What’s the difference between Islandora 1.x and Islandora 8.x., n.d.). (See Figure 1 below.)</li>

<li>Islandora uses Blazegraph for querying its triple store. “Blazegraph DB is an ultra high-performance graph database supporting Blueprints and RDF/SPARQL APIs. It supports up to 50 Billion edges on a single node.” (Blazegraph, n.d.). “This replaces Mulgara. Formerly known as BigData. The intended use is solely for maintaining performant support of large Fedora repositories containing millions of objects.” (Replacing Mulgara with Blazegraph for High-Performance Low-Level Storage, n.d.).

<p>Islandora 8 supports nearly limitless use cases because of how the system is integrated to allow Drupal contributed modules to treat Fedora assets just like Drupal assets.

                <p>Islandora 8’s content modeling is based on ontology with a mix of Drupal’s microservices, context, and action solutions. Islandora objects are referred to as nodes. A node’s type is called a resource model. The resource models include (but are not limited to) audio, binary, collections, digital documents, images, pages, paged content, publication issue, and videos. In Islandora 7, content models refer to how derivatives are generated and how the object is displayed, however in Islandora 8 this concept doesn’t fit the behavior completely. When a model tag is applied to an object/node, this indicates to Drupal which context(s) to use resulting in corresponding actions to be fired. generating appropriate derivatives, resource mapping, and specifying an appropriate default viewer.</p>
<p>“Islandora 8 Data Model. Between the original capabilities of Drupal 8, the wealth of available modules, and the work that has already been done with Islandora 8, nearly any standard Islandora 7 content model can be represented in Islandora 8 from the simple (binary, PDF, image, audio, video) to the complex (compounds, books, newspapers). This is all done via the Repository Item content model which contains nearly all of the fields necessary to describe any type of object, and is the core of most of Islandora 8’s Drupal features. Many Drupal views and contexts can be triggered by targeting one or more of the fields in a Repository Item node in a way that makes requiring separate content types unnecessary. Examples include changing the template for displaying a node based on what “type” it is, or changing the viewer that is used based on the type of file a node has.” [<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Y7kGyVlrRW3uIqFPzMgQ2nj3gzB3U2FEO75X2n3bo8">link</a>] </p>
<ul>
<li>An object is a <em>node</em> (a.k.a. <em>content</em>).</li>
<li>Nodes have properties that can be configured called <em>fields</em>.</li>
<li>Fields for nodes are grouped together as <em>content types</em>.</li>
<li>Datastreams are <em>media</em>, which are <em>files</em> that can have their own fields and <em>media types</em>.</li>
<li>Metadata used to categorize entities are <em>taxonomy terms</em>, which also have their own fields and <em>vocabularies</em>. They can represent everything from simple labels to more complex concepts such as people, places, and subjects.</li>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Islandora 7 is a monolithic application that glues Drupal 6/7 to Fedora 3 with an optional institutional repository (IR) addon. Islandora 7 had several pain points, such as workflows, most of which required substantial coding to work around these issues. Although Islandora is  a collection of several Drupal 6/7 modules, it wasn’t written in a way that leveraged much of Drupal’s content management functionality. Fortunately the release of Drupal 8 has remedied this.</p>
<p>The Drupal 8 release in 2015 had a major overhaul of the code base. This meant that upgrading from Drupal 7 into Drupal 8 broke content libraries, functions, and theming. Drupal 8’s migration is an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process as part of its Migrate API. The data can come from a variety of places; a database, CSV, JSON, or REST function, and then transformed, imported, and processed (Migrate API overview, 2019).</p>
<p>Future upgrades of Drupal versions will look substantially different than before. Gone are the days of major migration planning as Drupal has completely overhauled their application lifecycle. Drupal 9 was released in June 2020 the process of upgrading won’t cause any loss in functionality or any libraries to break; the core is completely backwards compatible. This important feature was adopted  for the new life cycle for all future version releases. It was explained simply by Alex Lopez, “You’ll just get notices advising you to upgrade libraries, function calls, and anything else in your code that would make your module incompatible with a Drupal 10 version. But, theoretically, nothing that would break your module/site.”(2018). A large focus of Drupal core and module development for the 8 release was on specific industries, including but not limited to big data and higher education. “Build a wide range of solutions from university websites, applications, scholarly publishing, and more.” (Drupal for education, 2020).</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85065822-db814f80-b17b-11ea-8eb5-4ee294bae8fb.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="background" /></figure></p>
<p>Islandora changed the development approach to align with Drupal 8’s direction. A major focus on Islandora 8 is to build the stack in a way that fully utilizes Drupal 8 and make the contributed modules available. There are so many modules currently  developed and actively managed by other institutions that provide content modeling  and developing metadata has become exceedingly easier. As the need for IRs increases, the number of options available have increased as well making it sometimes difficult to sift through to find the best option for the community. Since these are so new, many of these lack sufficient documentation or guidance on how to best utilize the modules for a digital or institutional repository. The Islandora community makes every effort to bring content models together by research, community vetting, writing documentation, and creating solutions to help provide a ready made (turnkey) solution. Islandora 8 content is now utilizing Drupal nodes as the primary representation instead of how Islandora 7 overwrote Drupal routing to provide an object and it’s content. Islandora 8 content is Drupal content (stored in Fedora 5) and is completely compatible with 3rd party addons. In almost every cases the Islandora content is treated exactly the same as any other content imported into a base Drupal.</p>
