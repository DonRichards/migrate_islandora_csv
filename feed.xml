                <p>After all of the above pieces are in place, installed, configured, started, and otherwise prepared, the last thing we need to do is to finally configure the front-end Drupal instance to wire all the installed components together.</p>
<h2 id="drupal-pre-configuration">Drupal Pre-Configuration</h2>
<h3 id="settingsphp"><code>settings.php</code></h3>
<p>!!! notice
    By default, <code>settings.php</code> is read-only for all users. It should be made writable while this pre-configuration is being done, then set back to <code>444</code> afterwards.</p>
<p>Some additional settings will need to be established in your default <code>settings.php</code> before Drupal-side configuration can occur.</p>
<p>The below configuration will establish <code>localhost</code> as a trusted host pattern, but on production sites this will need to be expanded to include the actual host patterns used by the site.</p>
<p><code>/opt/drupal/web/sites/default/settings.php</code></p>

<h2 id="islandora">Islandora</h2>
<h3 id="downloading-islandora">Downloading Islandora</h3>
<p>The Islandora Drupal module contains the core code to create a repository ecosystem in a Drupal environment. It also includes several submodules; of importance to us is <code>islandora_core_feature</code>, which contains the key configurations that turn a Drupal site into an Islandora site.</p>
<p>Islandora also provides an <a href="https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_defaults"><code>islandora_defaults</code></a> module that contains additional configurations considered an appropriate launching point for configuring a site. We’re going to first enable the <code>islandora_defaults</code> module before doing any wiring on the front-end.</p>
<p>Take note of some of the other comments in the below bash script for an idea of what the other components are expected, and which may be considered optional.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd /opt/drupal
# This is a convenience piece that will help speed up most of the rest of our
# process working with Composer and Drupal.
sudo -u www-data composer require zaporylie/composer-drupal-optimizations:^1.0

# Since islandora_defaults is near the bottom of the dependency chain, requiring
# it will get most of the modules and libraries we need to deploy a standard
# Islandora site.
sudo -u www-data composer require islandora/islandora_defaults:dev-8.x-1.x

# These can be considered important or required depending on your site&#39;s
# requirements; some of them represent dependencies of Islandora submodules.
sudo -u www-data composer require drupal/pdf:1.x-dev
sudo -u www-data composer require drupal/rest_oai_pmh:^1.0
sudo -u www-data composer require drupal/facets:^1.3
sudo -u www-data composer require drupal/restui:^1.16
sudo -u www-data composer require drupal/rdfui:^1.0-beta1
sudo -u www-data composer require drupal/content_browser:^1.0@alpha

# These tend to be good to enable for a development environment, or just for a
# higher quality of life when managing Islandora. That being said, devel should
# NEVER be enabled on a production environment, as it intentionally gives the
# user tools that compromise the security of a site.
sudo -u www-data composer require drupal/console:~1.0
sudo -u www-data composer require drupal/devel:^2.0
sudo -u www-data composer require drupal/admin_toolbar:^2.0

# Islandora also provides a theme called Carapace designed to work well out of
# the box with an Islandora site.
sudo -u www-data composer require islandora/carapace:dev-8.x-3.x</code></pre>
<h3 id="enabling-downloaded-components">Enabling Downloaded Components</h3>
<p>Components we’ve now downloaded using <code>composer require</code> can be enabled simultaneously via <code>drush</code>, which will ensure they are installed in the correct dependent order. Enabling <code>islandora_defaults</code> will also ensure all content types and configurations are set up in Islandora. The installation process for all of these modules will likely take some time.</p>
<p>!!! notice
    This list of modules assumes that all of the above components were downloaded using <code>composer require</code>; if this is not the case, you may need to pare down this list manually. It also includes <code>devel</code>, which again, should not be enabled on production sites.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd /opt/drupal

# If Carapace was downloaded, now is the time to enable and set it as well.
drush -y theme:enable carapace
drush -y config-set system.theme default carapace

# After all of this, rebuild the cache.
drush -y cr</code></pre>
<h3 id="adding-a-jwt-configuration-to-drupal">Adding a JWT Configuration to Drupal</h3>
<p>To allow our installation to talk to other services via Syn, we need to establish a Drupal-side JWT configuration using the keys we generated at that time.</p>
<p>Log onto your site as an administrator at <code>/user</code>, then navigate to <code>/admin/config/system/keys/add</code>. Some of the settings here are unimportant, but pay close attention to the <strong>Key type</strong>, which should match the key we created earlier (an RSA key), and the <strong>File location</strong>, which should be the ultimate location of the key we created for Syn on the filesystem, <code>/opt/keys/syn_private.key</code>.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="../../assets/adding_a_jwt_rsa_key.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Adding a JWT RSA Key" /></figure></p>
<p>Click <strong>Save</strong> to create the key.</p>
<p>Once this key is created, navigate to <code>/admin/config/system/jwt</code> to select the key you just created from the list. Note that before the key will show up in the <strong>Private Key</strong> list, you need to select that key’s type in the <strong>Algorithm</strong> section, namely <code>RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256 (RS256)</code>.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="../../assets/configuring_the_jwt_rsa_key_for_use.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Configuring the JWT RSA Key for Use" /></figure></p>
<p>Click <strong>Save configuration</strong> to establish this as the JWT key configuration.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-islandora">Configuring Islandora</h3>
<p>Navigate to the Islandora core configuration page at <code>/admin/config/islandora/core</code> to set up the core configuration to connect to Gemini. Of note here, the <strong>Gemini URL</strong> will need to be established to facilitate the connection to Fedora, and the appropriate <strong>Bundles with Gemini URI pseudo field</strong> types will need to be checked off.</p>
<p>!!! notice
    Any other Drupal content types you wish to synchronize with Fedora should also be checked off here.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="../../assets/configuring_islandora.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Configuring Islandora" /></figure></p>
<h3 id="configuring-islandora-iiif">Configuring Islandora IIIF</h3>
<p>Navigate to <code>/admin/config/islandora/iiif</code> to ensure that Islandora IIIF is pointing to our Cantaloupe server.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="../../assets/configuring_iiif.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Configuring Islandora IIIF" /></figure></p>
<p>Next, configure Openseadragon by navigating to <code>/admin/config/media/openseadragon</code> and ensuring everything is set up properly.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="../../assets/configuring_openseadragon.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Configuring Openseadragon" /></figure></p>
<h3 id="establishing-flysystem-as-the-default-download-method">Establishing Flysystem as the Default Download Method</h3>
<p>Navigate to <code>/admin/config/media/file-system</code> to set the <strong>Default download method</strong> to the one we created in our <code>settings.php</code>.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="../../assets/configuring_flysystem_to_use_fedora.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Configuring Flysystem to Use Fedora" /></figure></p>
<h3 id="giving-the-administrative-user-the-fedoraadmin-role">Giving the Administrative User the <code>fedoraAdmin</code> Role</h3>
<p>In order for data to be pushed back to Fedora, the site administrative user needs the <code>fedoraAdmin</code> role.</p>
<pre><code>cd /opt/drupal
sudo -u www-data drush -y urol &quot;fedoraadmin&quot; islandora</code></pre><h3 id="running-feature-migrations">Running Feature Migrations</h3>
<p>Finally, to get everything up and running, run the Islandora Core Features and Islandora Defaults migrations.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd /opt/drupal
sudo -u www-data drush -y -l localhost --userid=1 mim --group=islandora</code></pre>

        <content type="html">
            <![CDATA[
                <p>A functioning Islandora 8 Stack is made up of dozens of components working in synchronization with each other to store information in your repository, manage that information, and disseminate it intelligently to users. Whether running an installation using the provided Ansible playbook or installing the stack manually, it may be helpful to have a brief overview of all the components we’re going to need, in the order we’re going to install them, as well as a brief introduction to each component’s installation and configuration process.</p>
<p>This list includes four different kinds of components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Components which are hard-required (such as Drupal and the Islandora module)</li>
<li>Components for which defaults are provided but which can be swapped out (such as the software managing databases, or the repository’s storage system)</li>
<li>Components that can’t easily be swapped out but are not necessarily required (such as using Solr as the site’s internal search engine)</li>
<li>Components which do not have official alternatives and are not necessarily required, but will likely exist on the vast majority of Islandora 8 installations (such as Alpaca and Crayfish)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-webserver-stack---apache-php-and-mysqlpostgresql">The Webserver Stack - Apache, PHP, and MySQL/PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>Combined together, Apache, PHP, and MySQL/PostgreSQL comprise a LAMP or LAPP server used to provide end-user-facing components - namely, the website.</p>
<p><strong>Apache</strong> is the webserver that will serve up webpages to the public. It will also manage some internal funcionality provided by Crayfish, and will expose Cantaloupe to the public. We’ll be making changes to the VirtualHost entry, enabling some modules, and modifying the ports configuration. The VirtualHost entry will eventually be modified when we need to expose other services like Cantaloupe to the public.</p>
<p><strong>PHP</strong> is the runtime interpreter for all the code Drupal and Crayfish need to be processed. By default, installing PHP 7.2 will give us a command-line interpreter, as well as an interpreter for Apache. We’re going to install several PHP modules required and/or useful for the components that make use of PHP.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> are database management systems that we will use to store information for many different components like Drupal and Fedora. By default, the Ansible playbook installs MySQL, though this can be switched to PostgreSQL. The manual installation guide recommends and walks through installing and using PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2 id="the-front-facing-cdm---composer-drush-and-drupal">The Front-Facing CDM - Composer, Drush, and Drupal</h2>
<p>Composer will be used to install both Drupal and Drush simultaneously using Islandora’s fork of the <a href="https://github.com/Islandora/drupal-project">drupal-project</a> repository.</p>
<p><strong>Composer</strong> is an installer and dependency manager for PHP projects. We’re going to need it to install components for any PHP code we need to make use of, including Drupal and Crayfish.</p>
<p><strong>Drush</strong> and <strong>Drupal</strong> are installed simultaneously using <a href="https://github.com/Islandora/drupal-project">drupal-project</a>. Drupal will serve up webpages and manage Islandora content, and Drush will help us get some things done from the command-line.</p>
<h2 id="the-web-application-server---tomcat-and-cantaloupe">The Web Application Server - Tomcat and Cantaloupe</h2>
<p>Several applets will be deployed via their <code>.war</code> files into Tomcat, including Fedora and Cantaloupe.</p>
<p><strong>Tomcat</strong> serves up webpages and other kinds of content much like Apache, but is specifically designed to deploy Java applications as opposed to running PHP code.</p>
<p><strong>Cantaloupe</strong> is an image tileserver that Islandora will connect to and use to serve up extremely large images in a way that doesn’t have an adverse effect on the overall system.</p>
<h2 id="the-back-end-file-management-repository---fedora-syn-and-blazegraph">The Back-End File Management Repository - Fedora, Syn, and Blazegraph</h2>
<p>Fedora will be installed in its own section, rather than as part of the Tomcat installation, as the installation process is rather involved and requires some authorization pieces to be set up in order to connect them back to Drupal and other components.</p>
<p><strong>Fedora</strong> is the default backend repository that Islandora content will be synchronized with and stored in. A great deal of configuration will be required to get it up and running, including ensuring a database is created and accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Syn</strong> is the authorization piece that allows Fedora to connect to other components.</p>
<p><strong>Blazegraph</strong> will store representative graph data about the repository that can be queried using SPARQL. Some configuration will also be required to link it back to Fedora, as well as to ensure it is being properly indexed.</p>
<h2 id="the-search-engine---solr-and-search_api_solr">The Search Engine - Solr and search_api_solr</h2>
<p>The installation of Solr itself is rather straightforward, but a configuration will have to be generated and applied from the Drupal side.</p>
<p><strong>Solr</strong> will be installed as a standalone application. Nothing of particular importance needs to happen here; the configuration will be applied when <code>search_api_solr</code> is installed.</p>
<p><strong>search_api_solr</strong> is the Drupal module that implements the Solr API for Drupal-side searches. After installing and configuring the module, the <code>drush solr-gsc</code> command will be used to generate Solr configs, and these configs will be moved to the Solr configuration location.</p>
<h2 id="the-asynchronous-background-services---crayfish">The Asynchronous Background Services - Crayfish</h2>
<p><strong>Crayfish</strong> is a series of microservices that perform different asynchronous tasks kicked off by Islandora. It contains a series of submodules that will be installed via Composer. Later, these configured components will be connected to Alpaca.</p>
<h2 id="the-broker-connecting-everything---karaf-and-alpaca">The Broker Connecting Everything - Karaf and Alpaca</h2>
<p><strong>Karaf</strong>’s job is similar to Tomcat, except where Tomcat is a web-accessible endpoint for Java applets, Karaf is simply meant to be a container for system-level applets to communicate via its OSGI. Alpaca is one such applet; it will broker messages between Fedora and Drupal, and between Drupal and various derivative generation applications.</p>
<p><strong>Alpaca</strong> contains Karaf services to manage moving information between Islandora, Fedora, and Blazegraph as well as kicking off derivative services in Crayfish. These will be configured to broker between Drupal and Fedora using an ActiveMQ queue.</p>
<h2 id="finalized-drupal-configurations">Finalized Drupal Configurations</h2>
<p><strong>Drupal configuration</strong> exists as a series of .yaml files that can either be created in a feature, or exported from Drupal using the <code>content_sync</code> module. It can also be manually entered in via the UI. We’re going to place configuration in a few different ways; Some content will be synchronized onto the site, and some core configurations from the main Islandora module will need to be run in order to facilitate ingest.</p>

<p>This messes up me all the time. So much so I created a <a href="https://gist.github.com/DonRichards/ce71c2b18e1567a61ea8fe96b3e8ed70">script</a> I just have running in the background to force all updates after they’re written. This isn’t absolutely nessisary but I find it useful. </p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ drush -y fim migrate_islandora_csv</code></pre>
<h3 id="typical-migration">Typical Migration</h3>
<p>It’s highly suggested to migrate by group so the order of operations work in your favor. This is a typic execution of that. </p>
<p><em>Remember that the order of operations is important (taxonomy terms like persons and subjects should go first, files, node, and lastly media) if you haven’t previously imported them. This is a problem if the dependencies are properly specified or the <code>--execute-dependencies</code> isn’t added to the import. The <code>-d</code> is for debugging. This will add a little time to the process. And you will need to include <code>--userid=1</code> to this. I have experienced issues not using it.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">drush migrate:import --userid=1 --execute-dependencies --group=knoxgardens_migrate_islandora_csv -d</code></pre>
<h3 id="debugging-migration">Debugging Migration</h3>
<p>Migrate:import has a lot of options. This is the complete list. I won’t go over most of them. To read more on <a href="https://drushcommands.com/drush-8x/migrate/migrate-import/">drush migrate-import</a></p>

<p>Migration test are done one migration yml at a time by specifying the migration ID. To get a list of installed migrations with the status and group name(s) run migrate status:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ drush migrate:status

 &quot;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To only run against a specific object. Within each of the yml files a <strong>key</strong> is specified. The <strong>key</strong> is saying for each unique one of these iterate through. If the the <strong>key</strong> is to to <code>key: PID</code> and the PID we want to migrate/update is <em>islandora:4223</em> we can the following command. Using a value with special characters gives me some concern so I suggest just adding sequential numbers as the first colunm in the CSV calling it <strong>ID</strong> to avoid possible issues. I have not personally tested using a PID as the key but I’m using it here to illustrate.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">#         id of the yml file   ┐                 ┌ Respect the order of operations

<h2 id="rolling-back">Rolling back</h2>
<p>This process has a small flaw. The original file is left in the Bigdata log and fills up the VM very quickly. It will eventually remove itself but I haven’t found a simple way to trigger a cron to clear it. The process can be done quickly but there is probably a fast way than I have been doing it. I suggest only rolling back when you have extra files or to remove remove the content entirely. If you plan on just updating, just use the <code>--update</code> switch. </p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ drush migrate:rollback --userid=1 --group=knoxgardens_migrate_islandora_csv -d

<p>Deleting a migration (rare but it happens). If you’ve previously created a file like <em>druid_mods_file_migration.yml</em> and ran it. That configuration was imported into Drupal’s config. Deleting the module file will not remove it from Drupal’s config. You either need to overwrite it or delete it all together.</p>

<p>Althought there are really straight forward migration tutorials like <a href="https://understanddrupal.com/articles/tips-writing-drupal-migrations-and-understanding-their-workflow">this</a> one. All of the migration content on this and previous pages have been done without leveraging the more powerful part of a Drupal migration, custom PHP code to handle advanced beahviors. Here is an <a href="https://agaric.coop/blog/adding-extra-source-properties-drupal-migrations">example</a> of how to do this. </p>

<p>For clients interested in an initial install or migration, again we start with an audit of existing systems and digital collections, as well as on-staff capabilities. We present a plan which dovetails with our client’s team, augmenting their expertise and availability. Sometimes we shoulder the full project effort, but we have found that closer to an 80/20 split not only keeps project costs down, but also ensures that our clients are comfortable with their new systems by the time the site launches.</p>

<p>The map between Drupal URIs and their corresponding Fedora URIs is stored in a service called Gemini. An Islandora “pseudo-field” can be enabled that will display the corresponding Fedora URI on the page of a node, taxonomy term, or media object. You can also query Gemini directly. Instructions for doing that are provided below.</p>
<p>For more information about the Gemini service, see the <a href="https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/Crayfish/tree/master/Gemini">Gemini README</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-look-up-a-fedora-uri-through-gemini">How to look up a Fedora URI through Gemini</h3>
<p>(nodes and taxonomy terms)</p>
<p>In Gemini, each entry is keyed on the UUID assigned by Drupal (the long one, not the node id). To get the UUID of a node, or taxonomy term in Drupal, you can look in the Devel tab or in the JSON representation, e.g.: <em><a href="http://localhost:8000/node/2?_format=json">http://localhost:8000/node/2?_format=json</a></em>.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-look-up-a-fedora-uri-through-gemini-files">How to look up a Fedora URI through Gemini (files)</h3>
<p>Files in Fedora have the file URI in Gemini, and can be queried based on the UUID (accessible from the Media’s json) or their URI.</p>

                <p>The Portland Common Data Model (PCDM) is a flexible, extensible domain model that is intended to underlie a wide array of repository and DAMS applications. The primary objective of this model is to establish a framework that developers of tools (e.g., Samvera-based engines, such as Hyrax, Hyku, Sufia, and Avalon; Islandora; custom Fedora sites) can use for working with models in a general way, allowing adopters to easily use custom models with any tool. Given this interoperability goal, the initial work has been focused on structural metadata and access control, since these are the key actionable metadata.</p>
<p>To encourage adoption, this model must support the most complex use cases, which include rich hierarchies of inter-related collections and works, but also elegantly support the simplest use cases, such as a single user-contributed file with a few fields of metadata. It must provide a compact interface that tool developers can easily implement, but also be extensible enough for adopters to customize to their local needs.</p>
<p>As the community migrates to Fedora 5, much of our metadata is migrating to RDF. This model encourages linked data best practices, such as using URIs to identify all resources, using widely-used vocabularies where possible, and subclassing existing classes and properties when creating new terms.</p>

<ul>
<li>An Object is an intellectual entity, sometimes called a “work”, “digital object”, etc. Objects have descriptive metadata, access metadata, may contain files and other Objects as member “parts” or “components”. Each level of a work is therefore represented by an Object instance, and is capable of standing on its own, being linked to from Collections and other Objects. Member Objects can be ordered using the ORE Proxy class.</li>

<li>A Collection is a group of resources. Collections have descriptive metadata, access metadata, and may link to Objects and/or Collections. By default, member Objects and Collections are an unordered set, but can be ordered using the ORE Proxy class.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm/wiki#pcdmfile">pcdm:File</a></p>
<ul>
<li>A File is a sequence of binary data and is described by some accompanying metadata. The metadata typically includes at least basic technical metadata (size, content type, modification date, etc.), but can also include properties related to preservation, digitization process, provenance, etc. Files MUST be contained by exactly one Object.</li>

<p>WebACLs comes with Fedora 5 but is not recomended. Drupal permission management is more robust and is the suggested option for access control. </p>

                <h3 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h3>
<p>Islandora 8 used the MODS to <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/download/attachments/87460857/MODS-RDF-Mapping-Recommendations_SMIG_v1_2019-01.pdf?api=v2">RDF Mapping Recommendations</a> document from <em>Samvera MODS to RDF Working Group</em> to create initial mappings. Islandora consist of multiple yaml files for different content types corporate_body, family, geo_location, person, resource_type and subject. Create a mapping for each one of these and the bulk of the work is done. YAML files can iterate over several posibilities and output the one desired RDF value. It directly links and pulls data from several namespace APIs with some configuration. Minting object mappings will need the URI sourced from an external vocabulary, URI for a local object, or a literal value (text string). Minting is covered on the <a href="/oai-pmh-and-doi-minting">OAI-PMH and DOI minting</a>.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>In Islandora, the JSON-LD Module transforms nodes (or media, or taxonomy terms) into the RDF that is synced into Fedora and the Triplestore. It uses RDF mappings, a concept defined by the RDF Module, and exposes them through the REST API at <code>?_format=jsonld</code>. Functionality can be expanded by RDF schema building schema.org configuration tool (RDF UI).</p>
<h3 id="json-ld-module">JSON-LD Module</h3>
<p>Using the RDF mapping configurations provided by the RDF module, the JSON-LD Module exposes the RDF-mapped entity in JSON-LD, through the REST API, at</p>
<ul>
<li>Node:  <code>node/[nid]?_format=jsonld</code></li>
<li>Media: <code>media/[mid]?_format=jsonld</code> </li>
<li>Terms:  <code>taxonomy/term/[tid]?_format=jsonld</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rdf-mappings">RDF Mappings</h3>
<p>In an out-of-the-box islandora-playbook, the RDF mappings that exist were loaded from config files, and correspond to the <code>rdf.mapping.[...].yml</code> files located in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media terms: <code>/islandora/modules/islandora_core_feature/config/install/</code></li>
<li>Taxonomy terms: <code>/islandora_defaults/config/install/</code></li>
<li>Repository_item and the islandora_access vocabulary: <code>/controlled_access_terms/modules/controlled_access_terms_defaults/config/install/</code></li>
<li>The default corporate_body, family, geo_location, person, resource_type and subject vocabularies: <code>/core/profiles/standard/config/install/ (articles, pages, comments, and tags)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For a detailed description on how to generate and/or edit RDF mappings <a href="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/islandora/rdf-mapping/#how-to-edit-an-rdf-mapping">link</a></p>
<p><strong>Namespaces</strong>
ldp, ebucore, pcdm, are premis are registered in islandora.module using hook_rdf_namespaces(). To register your own namespaces, you will need to locate create a custom module that implements that hook.</p>

<h4 id="an-example-of-a-custom-rdf-mapping">An example of a custom RDF Mapping</h4>
<p>Below is an example of an RDF mapping as a .yml (YAML) file. It is the current version of the RDF mapping of the Repository Item (islandora_object) bundle, provided by islandora_defaults and exportable as rdf.mapping.node.islandora_object.yml).</p>
<p>The top level key types specifies the rdf:type of the resource or content model. field_model, a required field of Islandora objects, also gets mapped to rdf:type through an arcane back-end process.
The top level key fieldMappings specifies fields attached to that bundle and their RDF property mappings. One field can be mapped to more than one RDF property. It is a simple flat list.
datatype_callback : [needs documentation]
mapping_type: rel : [needs documentation]</p>
<p>To see your current RDF for an Islandora Object go to the Synchronize Export Single item page (/admin/config/development/configuration/single/export) and select 
<strong>Configuration type</strong>: RDF Mapping
<strong>Configuration name</strong>: node.islandora_object</p>
<p>Looking over this configuration the <code>field_rights</code> properties is set to <code>dc:rights</code>. This means currently the rights statement requires that this field needs to be set for every object/node with this rights statement and if the statement changes all of them requires an edit. Although mostly trivial this isn’t very dynamic and doesn’t really follow the principles of linked data. </p>

<h3 id="how-to-create-a-custom-vocab">How to create a custom vocab</h3>
<p>Moving the <strong>rights statement</strong> in it’s own taxonomy vocabularly adds the ability to show the rights statement and URI link to rightsstatement.org. To accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a Taxonomy Vocabulary for “Rights Statement”</li>
<li>Either migrate or add in each “term” like <code>In Copyright</code> giving it an authority link, name and description.</li>
<li>Create a mapping for the “Rights Statement” vocabulary by importing via a <strong>single Import</strong> configuration page. </li>
<li>Replace the Rights string field with a with a Rights <strong>Entity Reference</strong> pointing to the new vocab.</li>
</ul>

                <p>During ingests/migrations there are several items that have been covered by different sections of this document. It helps to have a working knowledge of linked data, RDF, and ontology &amp; vocabulary basics vs repository-specific ontologies to create a comprehensive migration/ingest. Names, files, metadata along with the DOI is important to have a firm understanding of how this information is related to process it correctly.</p>
<p>Example of Islandora 7x to 8x for the same object after migrated.
<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/88409952-af24a880-cda3-11ea-9749-c135a55335ac.jpg"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/88409952-af24a880-cda3-11ea-9749-c135a55335ac.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="side by side Islandora versions of object display" /></figure></a></p>
<h2 id="batch-processingmigrating">Batch Processing/Migrating</h2>
<p><a href="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#ingesting-files">Ingesting Files</a> according to the documentation the Migrate API is the main way to ingest batches of data into Drupal (and because Islandora 8 is Drupal, into Islandora). The Migrate module only provides the framework, it’s up to you to create the rules that take data from a source, through a process (i.e. a mapping) to a destination. A set of these rules is called a “migration”. It has to be set up (as a Configuration Entity, either by importing a YAML file or by installing a Feature) and then it has to be ran.</p>
<p>In a nutshell the steps are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a CSV file.</li>
<li>Create a yml for each type of entity (person, place, event, university, etc) needing to mint. </li>
<li>Create a “file” yml configuration file for the files.</li>
<li>Create a “media” yml configuration file for the files to specify their media behavior once in Drupal.</li>
<li>Create a “node” yml configuration file for gluing the file and media to a node. It the Islandora 7 terminology this would be the “object”.</li>
</ol>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/86034395-88738c00-ba08-11ea-8aaa-48bea9d0cc97.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Screenshot of Migrate UI" /></figure></p>
<p>Althought this process can be done in the admin UI, it’s highly suggested to use drush commands. The UI doesn’t respect order of operations and very little information is given from the admin UI when there is an error.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/87075911-0bf26180-c1ef-11ea-91ed-f6e7cfca0140.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="migrate status in the terminal" /></figure></p>

<h2 id="important-notes">Important Notes</h2>
<h3 id="dates">Dates</h3>
<p>It’s highly recomended to convert dates to EDTF. EDTF field type is for recording dates in Extended Date Time Format, which is a format based off of the hyphenated form of ISO 8601 (e.g. 1991-02-03 or 1991-02-03T10:00:00), but also allows expressions of different granularity and uncertainty.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/metadata_edtf_valid.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Metadata edtf valid form" /></figure></p>
<p>This doesn’t have to be done on the original metadata (MODS), it can be done in the transform process of the migration. The configuration for the Default EDTF Widget (including options for extra strict date validation, and allowing date intervals and date sets).</p>

<h3 id="getting-metadata-into-fedora-and-a-triple-store">Getting Metadata into Fedora and a Triple-store</h3>
<p>The above sections described how Drupal manages and stores metadata, but Islandora 8 provides for pushing that metadata into a Fedora 4+ repository and a triple-store. Islandora does this by using Drupal’s serialization capabilities to provide a JSON-LD serialization that can be ingested by Fedora 4+ repository and triple-stores. In response to actions taken as a result of if-then configurations in Contexts, Islandora sends notifications to the repository and triple-store that an entity available to ingest.</p>
<p>The JSON-LD module (written for Islandora) takes an entity and its corresponding RDF mapping (a structure defined by the contributed RDF module) to create a JSON-LD serialization. An RDF mapping for a content type, media type, or vocabulary lists its fields and the RDF predicates that should be used for them.</p>
<p>The JSON-LD serialization for an entity is available by appending ?_format=jsonld to the entity’s URL. This particular syntax takes advantage of the REST API module. Below is an example JSONLD document representing the RDF serialization of a Repository item node created in a standard islandora-playbook based vagrant VM:</p>

<h3 id="maintaining-uri-reference--relationships">Maintaining URI reference &amp; relationships</h3>
<p>Migrating the URI associated with a person, place, event, etc. is an essential requirement for UTK. This process will demonstrate how to retain the URIs we have when we migrate and support complex graph relationships. To take full advantage of this, the taxonomy vocabularies (person, geographic location, subject, event, etc.) needs to be migrated or created first. Once the taxonomy term is migrated, the relationship needs to be specified on the node along with the previously created taxonomy reference URI. <strong>Islandora Defaults</strong> provides a ‘Linked Agent’ field as part of the Repository Item content type, and populates the available relationships from the MARC relators list. By utilizing this, the Entity (for example in this illustration is the person term  <strong>Van Vactor</strong>) and his MARC relator is <strong>Composer</strong>. 
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/86975470-62579580-c146-11ea-8f20-ddc6b53edebe.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="vanvactor_example" /></figure></p>
<p>The list of available relations for this field is configurable at ‘/admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/fields/node.islandora_object.field_linked_agent’. If you re-use this existing field on another content type, you can define different available relations for that instance of the field. Relations are defined in the format key|value, and the key is used in the RDF mapping (see below).</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/metadata_available_relations_config.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="key|value RDF mapping" /></figure></p>
<p>Unlike other fields, which can be assigned RDF predicates in RDF Mapping yaml files, a typed relation field uses a different predicate depending on the chosen “type”. These predicates are assigned using the ‘keys’ in the key|value configuration. The key must be formated namespace:predicate, e.g. relators:act. The namespace (‘relators’) must be pre-defined in code, using a hook. See the RDF Mapping section of Create / Update a Content Type for more details, including a list of available pre-defined namespaces.</p>
<p>For more information see <a href="/metadata-and-metadata-sharing#Typed-Relation">Metadata and Metadata Sharing #Typed-Relation</a> and <a href="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/metadata/">Islandora’s Metadata Documentation</a></p>
<h3 id="single-objects-using-the-ui">Single Objects (using the UI)</h3>
<p>Before you start ingesting identify all of the entities (taxonomy vocabulary term reference) that needs to be created first (person, events, geographic locations, subjects, etc.) if it doesn’t already exist. You can create them in paralelle while filling out the ingest form. To create a new term go the the category it falls into (person, events, geographic locations, subjects, etc.) and click “List Terms” then “Add Term”. </p>

<h3 id="technical-notes">Technical Notes</h3>
<p>If you want to upload large (&gt; 1GB) files, the VM provided by the community has some options not set. You’ll need to tune the following settings in your php.ini:</p>
<ul>
<li>upload_max_filesize – The maximum allowed upload file size.</li>
<li>post_max_size – The maximum allowed POST data size.</li>
<li>max_input_time – Maximum allowed input time.</li>
<li>max_execution_time – The maximum allowed time the scripts are allowed to run.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, large file transfer over HTTP still has a host of issues once you properly configure your server. PHP’s integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit integers, some filesystem functions may return unexpected results for files which are larger than 2GB and could cause <code>filesize</code> to report the UI an incurrate reading. It won’t cause functions to fail just to not report correctly. This is a reported flaw within <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filesize.php">PHP</a>. </p>

<p>The simpliest way to implement a highly customizable submit, review, accept, publish workflow is to leverage Drupal’s Content Moderation. Most of the needed steps have already be accomplished by existing modules and workflows. Once the content has been reviewed it can be passed as a node and several aditional actions can be fired at this or and other stage of the submissions/publish process.</p>
<h3 id="needed-modules">Needed Modules</h3>
<p>★ Drupal’s Core Module Content Moderation</p>
<h3 id="user-groups">User groups</h3>
<p>Create some user roles (admin &gt; people &gt; roles). For this example the following roles would be useful to add.</p>
<ul>
<li>Student</li>
<li>Thesis Manager</li>
<li>Dissertation Manager</li>
</ul>
<p>We will set thier permissions later but for now create a user for each of these and add the corresponding roles. </p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85894536-eadb4b00-b7c2-11ea-86e5-fd7b0b825b59.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="users and roles" /></figure></p>
<h3 id="special-permissions-considerations">Special Permissions Considerations</h3>
<p>Repository content should not be immediately accessible to the public. The Drupal 8 module <em>permissions_by_term</em> and the sub-module <em>permissions_by_entity</em> allows us to create a ‘ETD-submission’ term that, when applied to nodes and media will restrict access to them (and files as an extension of media) to permission group members.</p>
<p>However, access to files will only be checked if they are in a managed filesystem such as the Drupal private filesystem or one provided by a Flysystem adapter (like the Fedora Adapter provided by Islandora 8). When Islandora 8 creates derivate media it places them in the public filesystem by default. This is generally a good idea because it is more performant than other filesystems but then derivatives of restricted items become publicly accessible, which is not what we want. A repository manager can change the derivative actions to save them into either the private of Fedora filesystems, but this comes at a performance cost when accessing files that are publicly accessible.</p>
<p>Enter <em>file_access_fix</em>. This handy module will check an entity (node, media, etc.) on update to see if it has any referenced files. If so, it will check if the entity is available by Anonymous users and will move the file to the appropriate filesystem, either public or private, based on it’s availability. So, if I create a derivative that is saved in the private filesystem by default, this module will check to see if the media is publicly accessible, if so, it will move it to the more performant public filesystem for me! If I ever decide that the media actually should be restricted, the module will move the file from the public filesystem back to the private one. See more on <a href="https://seth-shaw-unlv.github.io/2020-06-23/permissions_by_term_file_access_fix">Permissions By Entity &amp; File Access Fix</a></p>
<h3 id="create-custom-types">Create Custom types</h3>
<p>Create Custom “Thesis, Dissertation, and Supplemental” <strong>media</strong> types and “Thesis, Dissertation” <strong>content</strong> types. Create the media types first. </p>
<h4 id="create-media-types">Create Media Types</h4>
<p>The Media Types list should now include Supplimental, Thesis and Dissertation (Admin &gt; Structure &gt; Media Types)</p>
<p>Since objects in Islandora 8 are stored in Drupal as Nodes, we use the standard Drupal Content Types system to create and edit our ‘ingest forms’ <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/administering-drupal-8-site/managing-content-0/working-with-content-types-and-fields">Content Types in Drupal 8</a>. Islandora 8 forms are Drupal forms, and if you are already familiar with Drupal Field UI, you’re already well equipped to create and modify your own ingest forms in Islandora 8.</p>
<p>Highly recomended that you follow the <a href="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/content_types/#create-a-content-type">Islandora documentation</a> instructions. </p>

<h4 id="create-content-types">Create Content Types</h4>
<ul>
<li>Go to admin &gt; structure &gt; content types and click Add content type</li>
<li>Give it a name “Thesis Content”<ul>
<li>In the default options, uncheck <strong>Published</strong> and <strong>Promoted to front page</strong> then click save and manage fields. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By default it comes with a <strong>Body</strong> field. We need to add 2 File types (1 for the PDF and 1 for any supplimental files) to attach to the sumission. The PDF is required but the supplimental files isn’t. </p>
<ul>
<li>Click Add Field</li>
<li>Select from the “Add a new field” dropdown <strong>Media</strong><ul>
<li>Add a label “thesis_pdf” and click save</li>

<p>Click on Manage Form Display and drag <strong>Published</strong>, <strong>Sticky at the top of the lists</strong>, and <strong>Promote to front page</strong> to the disabled section and hit save.</p>
<h3 id="moderation-workflow-setup">Moderation Workflow Setup</h3>
<p>There are 3 categories to set up; states, transitions, assign to specific content types.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>States</strong>: The different states the submission could possible be in<ul>
<li>Submitted, reviewed and waiting for update, embargoed, published, tombstoned, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transitions</strong>: Applying actions when transitioning from one state to another.<ul>
<li><em>From (submitted, waiting for update, under review) to published</em></li>
<li><em>From (published, embargoed) to tombstoned</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Create all of the states and transitions. There is very little instructions needed to achieve this. Add <strong>This workflow applies to:</strong> to <strong>media Type</strong>  <em>Thesis</em></p>

<h3 id="google-scholar-indexing">Google Scholar Indexing</h3>
<p>Google Scholar has many requirements and a few alternatives to those requirements. Mainly the content hosted on your website must consist primarily of scholarly articles - journal papers, conference papers, technical reports, or their drafts, dissertations, pre-prints, post-prints, or abstracts. Content such as news or magazine articles, book reviews, and editorials is not appropriate for Google Scholar. Content must make either the full text of the articles or their complete author-written abstracts freely available above the fold. There are several other restrictions that can be found at <a href="https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#overview">Google Scholar Inclusion Guidelines</a></p>
<h4 id="metatag-google-scholar"><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag_google_scholar">Metatag Google Scholar</a></h4>
<p>Currently the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag_google_scholar">Metatag Google Scholar</a> along with the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag">metatag</a> modules adds the following <em>Highwire Press</em> tags:</p>
<ul>
<li>citation_title</li>
<li>citation_author</li>
<li>citation_publication_date</li>
<li>citation_journal_title</li>
<li>citation_issn</li>
<li>citation_isbn</li>
<li>citation_volume</li>
<li>citation_issue</li>
<li>citation_firstpage</li>
<li>citation_lastpage</li>
<li>citation_dissertation_institution</li>
<li>citation_technical_report_institution</li>
<li>citation_technical_report_number</li>
<li>citation_pdf_url</li>
</ul>
<p>Example</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_title&quot; content=&quot;The testis isoform of the phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit (PhK-T) plays a critical role in regulation of glycogen mobilization in developing lung&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Liu, Li&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Rannels, Stephen R.&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Falconieri, Mary&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Phillips, Karen S.&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Wolpert, Ellen B.&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_author&quot; content=&quot;Weaver, Timothy E.&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_publication_date&quot; content=&quot;1996/05/17&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_journal_title&quot; content=&quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_volume&quot; content=&quot;271&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_issue&quot; content=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_firstpage&quot; content=&quot;11761&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_lastpage&quot; content=&quot;11766&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_pdf_url&quot; content=&quot;http://www.example.com/content/271/20/11761.full.pdf&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The title tag, e.g., citation_title or DC.title, must contain the title of the paper. Don’t use it for the title of the journal or a book in which the paper was published, or for the name of your repository. This tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>
<p>The author tag, e.g., citation_author or DC.creator, must contain the authors (and only the actual authors) of the paper. Don’t use it for the author of the website or for contributors other than authors, e.g., thesis advisors. Author names can be listed either as “Smith, John” or as “John Smith”. Put each author name in a separate tag and omit all affiliations, degrees, certifications, etc., from this field. At least one author tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>
<p>The publication date tag, e.g., citation_publication_date or DC.issued, must contain the date of publication, i.e., the date that would normally be cited in references to this paper from other papers. Don’t use it for the date of entry into the repository - that should go into citation_online_date instead. Provide full dates in the “2010/5/12” format if available; or a year alone otherwise. This tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</p>
<p>For journal and conference papers, provide the remaining bibliographic citation data in the following tags: citation_journal_title or citation_conference_title, citation_issn, citation_isbn, citation_volume, citation_issue, citation_firstpage, and citation_lastpage. Dublin Core equivalents are DC.relation.ispartof for journal and conference titles and the non-standard tags DC.citation.volume, DC.citation.issue, DC.citation.spage (start page), and DC.citation.epage (end page) for the remaining fields. Regardless of the scheme chosen, these fields must contain sufficient information to identify a reference to this paper from another document, which is normally all of: (a) journal or conference name, (b) volume and issue numbers, if applicable, and (c) the number of the first page of the paper in the volume (or issue) in question.</p>
<p>For theses, dissertations, and technical reports, provide the remaining bibliographic citation data in the following tags: citation_dissertation_institution, citation_technical_report_institution or DC.publisher for the name of the institution and citation_technical_report_number for the number of the technical report. As with journal and conference papers, you need to provide sufficient information to recognize a formal citation to this document from another article.</p>
<p>For all document types, the guiding principle is to present your article as it would normally be cited in the “References” section of another paper. E.g., citations to technical reports normally include their assigned numbers, so the number of the report should be present in some appropriate field. Likewise, the name of the journal should be written as “Transactions on Magic Realism” or “Trans. Mag. Real.”, not as “Magic Realism, Transactions on” or “T12”. Omission or unusual presentation of key bibliographic fields can lead to mis-identification of your articles.</p>
<p>All tag values are HTML attributes, so you must escape special characters appropriately. E.g.,<code>&lt;meta name=&quot;citation_title&quot; content=&quot;&amp;quot;Andar com meus sapatos&amp;quot; - uma an&amp;#225;lise cr&amp;#237;tica&quot;&gt;</code>. There’s no need to escape characters that are written directly in your webpage’s character encoding, such as Latin diacritics on a page in ISO-8859-1. However, you must still escape the quotes and the angle brackets.</p>
<p>The <code>&quot;&lt;meta&gt;&quot;</code> tags normally apply only to the exact page on which they’re provided. If this page shows only the abstract of the paper and you have the full text in a separate file, e.g., in the PDF format, please specify the locations of all full text versions using citation_pdf_url or DC.identifier tags. The content of the tag is the absolute URL of the PDF file; for security reasons, it must refer to a file in the same subdirectory as the HTML abstract.</p>

<p>Although not common I can’t seem to locate a ready made solution for uploading content from Drupal 8 into Google Book Search’s API. It’s unknown how long this would take and it’s unlikely to be nessisary based on the sizes of the current dissertations currently being hosted in Bepress.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p><a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF</a> (International Image Interoperability Framework) is a set of specifications that provides interoperability of image-based collections across platforms. What this means for a repository platform like Islandora at a general level is that image-based objects such as (still) images and paged content can be managed by Islandora but viewed in external applications, and that Islandora can bring in image-based content from elsewhere to supplement locally managed content. If this intrigues you, see the section “Looking under the hood (and beyond)” below.</p>
<p>At a practial level, because Islandora supports several of the IIIF specifications, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom, pan, and rotate images within OpenSeadragon</li>
<li>Islandora uses an IIIF-compliant image server (by default, <a href="https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/">Cantaloupe</a>) that utilizes the IIIF Image API. This capablity is similar to what Islandora 7.x users experience when they view a Large Image.</li>
<li>Display thumbnails for all pages of a book or newspaper issue within image viewers</li>
<li>IIIF-compliant image viewers such as OpenSeadragon or Mirador can display a “collection” of images such as all the pages of a book or newspaper issue using the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/">IIIF Presentation API</a>. For example, here is a screenshot of OpenSeadragon rendering all the pages of a book: <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/osd_collection_mode.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="pages of a book" /></figure></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-iiif-in-islandora-8">Using IIIF in Islandora 8</h3>
<p>Implementation of the IIIF Presentation API is new in Islandora 8, and using it is as simple as configuring a Context (in fact, you don’t even need to configure it; the Context, Openseadragon Block, already exists by default). To use this Context, all that is required is for your book or newspaper (or other paged content) to be given a model of “Paged Content” or “Publication Issue”. Then, in the Openseadragon Block Context, make sure the term used in the “Node has term” condition (you can register more than one term there). Now, when you view a paged content Islandora object, you will see thumbnails of all of its child pages (assuming you have added some child pages to the object) in the OpenSeadragon viewer as illustrated above.</p>
<p>To view an object’s <strong>manifest</strong> navigate to the node’s URL and add <code>/manifest</code></p>
<p>Example: <code>http://myrepo.edu/node/23/manifest</code></p>
<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>
<p>IIIF-compliant viewers don’t need to be embedded in Islandora websites. If a viewer on another website knows the URL of a IIIF manifest like the ones that Islandora can produce, that viewer can display the content described in the manifest. Here’s an example of how a viewer can display from multiple external domains with just a manifest.
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85555851-4e634e00-b5f4-11ea-8bef-496bc6357385.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Mirador example with multiple sources" /></figure></p>

<p>Drupal for higher education is a large industry. There are several top universities that have been using Drupal for a veriety of acedemic purposes. Here is a small list of a few universities that (as of this writing) are using Drupal.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">Oxford University</a> Drupal 7.72</li>
<li><a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu">Harvard University</a> Drupal 7.69</li>

</ol>
<p>With the release of Drupal 8 several universities, venders and volunteers have created and contributed to Drupal module solutions to meet acedemic needs. Here is a list of a few Institutional Repository (IR) &amp; Research Data Management (RDM) related modules currently available for Drupal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Scholar: Google Scholar(GS) provides a simple way to broadly search for scholarly literature. From one place, you can search across many disciplines and sources: articles, theses, books, abstracts and court opinions, from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities and other web sites. Google Scholar helps you find relevant work across the world of scholarly research. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/project-images/about_scholar.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="gs logo" /></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag">Metatag</a>: automatically provide structured metadata, aka “meta tags”, about a website.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/images/Meta%20tags%20%7C%20Drupal%207%20test%20site.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="metatag screenshot" /></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/seo_checklist">SEO Checklist</a> GS indexing crawlers rely on Googlebot to index a site. All of the typical Google crawler requirements need to be met for GS to index a site. That’s what makes a module like this critical.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/linked_data_field">Linked Data Lookup Field</a>: Supports Library of Congress Subject Headings, Global Research Identifier Database (GRID) entries, and CrossRef Funder identifiers and autocompletes the values out of the box. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/project-images/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-30%20at%202.22.31%20PM_0.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Linked Data Lookup Field screenshot" /></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers">Persistent Identifiers</a>: for minting and persisting persistent identifiers (Handles, DOIs, ARKs, etc.). <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers/raw/master/docs/images/mint_checkbox.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="mint screenshot" /></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/orcid">ORCID</a>: ORCID integration and allowing users to login with ORCID credentials. The developer explained that this access has access to all of the user’s content from orcid.org. Some small amount of code needs to be written to port the content to drupal.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mjordan/ip_range_access">IP restrictions</a>: The Condition and Reaction are independent of each other (Context) but if your intent is to block a user from accessing content based on their IP address.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/user_progress">User Progress API</a>: The User progress API module was sponsored by the Pennsylvania State University. It has been developed for charting students’ progression throughout a system.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/workflows/overview">Drupal Workflows</a> is a core Drupal feature and is well documented. This was complicated in Drupal 7/Islandora 7 but now this process is trivial and is built into Drupal 8.</p>

<p>There are Institutional Repository (IR) &amp; Research Data Management (RDM) solutions in production. As of the writing of this there is 1 university running Islandora 8 as an IR in production, <a href="https://oaks.kent.edu">Kent State University</a> and 1 an Islandora 8 RDM portal at <a href="https://islandora-rdm.researchspaces.ca">UPEI</a></p>

<p>Develop features in Islandora 8 and integrations with other services that provides a comprehensive research data management platform that is informed by the <a href="https://islandora-rdm.researchspaces.ca/node/4">FAIR principles</a>. The project seeks to develop integrations with identifier, metadata, authentication, storage, and dissemination systems and services that support the research data lifecycle and FAIR principles - that is making research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The project is an out-of the box profile (with configurable but sensible defaults) for institutions wanting to curate and manage research data over its lifecycle.</p>

<p>This system created a Drupal content type that represents a research data management plan.  DMPRoadMap is software used by DMPTool in the US, DMPOnline in Europe. In Canada, the DMP Assistant in Canada is moving towards that framework. The draft Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy highlights the importance of DMPs as a best practices in research data management and this feature provides researchers with a tool to help them meet emerging funding requirements. This content type models a generic funder template and associated guidance modeled on the DMPRoadMap. It is possible to have Conditional fields to provide specific funder templates.</p>
<p>This module directly integrates ORCID oauth login relating their user profile with thier ORCID ID and giving them the ability to link thier submitted content with ORCID.

<li>Supports roles and role types. These are all controls managed by Drupal’s User management along with the core mediation module.<ul>
<li>Anonymous users</li>
<li>Submitter: authenticated user; can submit items (objects) to one or more collections</li>
<li>Collection administrator/Editor - can add/remove submitters to a collection; can approve and publish / reject submissions; can edit item metadata; can withdraw items from public view; can deligate reviewers to submissions through roles.</li>
<li>Reviewer - can view an item not yet published and provide comments to Collection administrator/Editor.</li>
<li>Repository administrator - can perform all functions of the collection administrator for the
entire repository; can add new collections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personalized system access for registered users and segregated submission workspace through basic workflow setup can be complished with almost exclusively Drupal core modules.</li>
<li>Again Drupal’s user management supports assigning multiple roles with users in the system with different permissions</li>
<li>Ability to upload files over 2 GB via GUI into the system.</li>
<li>Ability for submitters to upload objects into the system and have that item published by a user with another role and was covered by a previous requirement.<ol start="6">
<li>Ability to create a metadata only record that refers to an externally hosted object. Depending on the type of content this is mostly built into Drupal core code. When creating a <code>media</code> object this is basically what happens. The next step of either pointing to a local file or a remote resource is fiarly common with content management systems. </li>
<li>Generates persistent document identification (DOI) for creating permanent links to individual records (CNRI Handles, DOIs). Minting DOIs has been accomplished with the <a href="https://github.com/roblib/islandora_rdm/tree/8.x-1.x/islandora_rdm_datacite_doi">Islandora Research Data Management Platform</a> repository for datacite DOIs. For more information on minting DOIs please see <a href="/oai-pmh-and-doi-minting">OAI-PMH &amp; DOI Minting</a></li>
<li>There is no documentation or expressed interest from the community (as of yet) in automatic deposits via the SWORD protocol. </li>
<li>Ability to populate the repository from objects in an ORCID profile could mean a few things. There are several modules and options to look at for possible options. Here’s a couple <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/styles/grid-3-2x/public/project-images/orcid-logo.png?itok=xP0k1XQs" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="ORCID Importer Logo" /></figure><ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>adds a User entity field to store the user’s ORCID</li>
<li>adds an “Import ORCID data” button to the User’s profile page</li>

                <p>Drupal is a very popular and well-known CMS for educational websites. And it’s very important that Drupal has tools to deal with bibliography and citations. </p>
<h3 id="bibliography--citation-bibcite">Bibliography &amp; Citation (BibCite)</h3>
<p>The Bibliography &amp; Citation project (aka <strong><a href="https://www.drupal.org/case-study/bibliography-and-citation-module-for-drupal-8">BibCite</a></strong>) is a Drupal contributed module that helps to organize and save bibliographic data about the content ranging from web pages to books and scientific research works. The module gives a field to export a citation of sources according to thousands of standards that have been accepted at different times in different organizations. </p>
<p>BibCite provides an API for bibliographic citations rendering. CSL styles are used for rendering. It also provides the administration UI which allows to choose a processor (currently only citeproc PHP is available) and to choose global CSL style.</p>
<p>You can also manage CSL styles from the administration UI - you can edit or delete a predefined style or install a new style manually or from .csl or xml files.
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/image-1-admin.csl-styles.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="bibCite admin console" /></figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bibliography &amp; Citation</strong>: It is a core module that provides API for a render of bibliography citation. The library we used is from official CSL style repository with over 8000 styles. Those styles are available without charge under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (BY-SA) license.</li>
<li><strong>Entity</strong>: Implements storage for bibliography data as Drupal entities: bibliography, contributor and keyword. Bibliography entity can be rendered as citations, exported and imported.</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong>: Provides the possibility to export bibliography content. Adds export links to citations (configurable)</li>
<li><strong>Import</strong>: Provides import feature and UI for import from files.</li>
<li><strong>BibTeX</strong>: Provides possibility to use BibTeX format for import and export.</li>
<li><strong>Endnote</strong>: Provides possibility to use EndNote 7 XML, EndNote X3 XML and EndNote Tagged formats for import and export.</li>
<li><strong>Marc</strong>: Provides possibility to use MARC format for import and export.</li>
<li><strong>RIS</strong>: Provides possibility to use RIS format for import and export.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bibliography--citation---crossref">Bibliography &amp; Citation - Crossref</h3>
<p>Provides DOI lookup functionality for the Bibliography &amp; Citation module.</p>

<p>Repositories can expose or harvest metadata, or both. OAI-PMH specifies six services which can be invoked over HTTP(s). The OAI-DC metadata format is aided by the Islandora OAI-PMH module to include the RDF Mapping for the linked agent field (from Islandora Defaults). Including agent links in the OAI-PMH metadata currently requires updating the RDF mapping to include a Dublin Core predicate for that field or any other additional fields. Alternatively, the rest_oai_pmh module also supports defining mappings with the metatag module or creating a custom metadata profile using the Twig templating system. For more information see Islandora 8’s documentation on <a href="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/oai/">OAI-PMH</a></p>

<h3 id="doi-minting">DOI Minting</h3>
<p>There are a few prebuilt modules for minting and persisting persistent identifiers (Handles, DOIs, ARKs, etc.). Minting can be done either during a migration, during a batch ingest or in the UI with one of these modules.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers">Persistent Identifiers</a></strong>: Module for minting and persisting persistent identifiers (Handles, DOIs, ARKs, etc.). </p>
<blockquote>
<p> Persistent identifiers can be minted by a variety of sources, such as CrossRef, DataCite, or EZID. Regardless of the specific source, many of the tasks involved in assigning persistent identifiers to Drupal nodes are the same - providing a “Mint Identifier” button in a node edit form, integration into automated workflows, or persisting identifiers to fields on an entity.
 This module provides some common tasks while allowing small amounts of code (specifically Drupal services) to handle the particulars of minting and persisting. In addition, a Drupal site admin might want to mix and match minting and persisting services. Generally speaking, this module’s goal is to allow site admins to select the minters and persisters they want, while helpin developers to write as little code as necessary to create new minter and persister services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mjordan/doi_datacite">DataCite DOI Minter</a></strong>: Module that mints DOIs from DataCite via the Persistent Identifiers module. This module allows for both individual and bulk operations.

<li>In May 2020 the Islandora Foundation announced they joined the Drupal Association as part of their <a href="https://islandora.ca/content/islandora-foundation-joins-drupal-association">Supporting Partner Program</a>. The Drupal Association is an educational non-profit organization that tasks itself with fostering and supporting the Drupal software project, the community and its growth.</li>

<li>The Islandora community is comprised of implementers, developers, service companies, and users working as transparently as possible toward better documentation and a better, always open-source, code base. We operate under a Code of Conduct. Membership formalizes involvement in the community and provides financial support for the project. Users get together across many channels, including:<ul>
<li>Calls: Islandora holds regular Islandora 7 Committers Calls and Islandora 8 Tech Calls. Developers, testers, and other interested parties come together to review tickets, issues, and development goals for Islandora.</li>
<li>Islandora Interest Groups are gatherings of Islandora community members who come together around a particular topic relevant to the Islandora ecosystem. The purpose of the interest group is to provide a forum for information exchange, mentorship and development within a limited area of interest and to report findings, submit code, documentation, recommendations as appropriate to the Islandora Coordinating Committee on matters of wider interest relating to the area of expertise. A recent example of an interest group collaboration was the survey and development of the Institutional repository Delta document. This was document specifies a definition was what the community declares the specifications of an out of the box IR solution. Although an IR repository is possible to assemble without a dedicated module it wouldn’t be a standardized process making community assistance a challenge. With help from the Google Scholar engineering team, the community developed with the help with feedback from the community drafted a document proposing an “Islandora Scholar” module that would bring together all the needed resources for a “turnkey” IR solution. Several options were left out deliberately that weren’t essential and could easily be accomplished with few steps from a tutorial. The Islandora interest group surveyed the community, reviewed existing IR options, and consulted with leading industry engineers. Creating a plan for a solution that meets the community’s needs and to precisely align the content in accordance with the Google Scholar engineering team’s feedback. Islandora has years of experience developing an institutional repository, originally developed in 2012 and the community is well equipped to handle the challenge of developing a solution that meets the community needs while maintaining the flexibility necessary for individual institutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vendors are constantly participating and contributing to the progression of the Islandora community and stack. They participate at a nearly daily occurrence and provide a lot of assistance to the community. See more on <a href="/vendors">Vendors</a></li>
<li>The onboarding process is well established with frequent workshops, video tutorials, 1-on-1 assistance from community members through zoom, and chat options. This makes the stack highly approachable to small colleges and large universities alike.</li>
<li>The Islandora community is a self-sustaining community of over 300 universities and an unknown number of private institutions, it’s clear that the community is well established.</li>
<li>With the platform mainly a “turnkey” repository option providing small and large repositories alike a relatively standardized solution with the flexibility of future growth built in.</li>
<li>The community has gravitated towards providing the options for the users to implement the latest information technology standards, iteratively improve the quality of the platform and inclusivity for the community to meet all of their needs for a repository.</li>
<li>The community engaged pedagogy embraces co-learning and is rooted in a respect for the prior knowledge and experiences that community partners bring to the conversation.</li>
<li>Expert discovery efforts (identifying improvements and developing solutions).</li>
<li>New efforts integrate the community into a broader community with Drupal. This means automated code review for security issues from Drupal, code hosting is hosted directly on Drupal’s Gitlab servers. Having all of Islandora and its contributed modules on Drupal means the update feature in the UI will recognize the modules and allow for module conflict avoidance and update integrations. This simplifies the update process greatly. </li>

                <p>For self hosted soltutions there are 2 basic deployment options; Ansible(a style we’re currently using) or deploying through Docker images.</p>
<ol>
<li>Islandora’s <a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook">Ansible playbook</a> comes with 2 preconfigured operating system defaults; Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS/7. The deployment can be configured for a local VM or a production deployment. “Ansible is the simplest solution for configuration management available. It’s designed to be minimal in nature, consistent, secure and highly reliable, with an extremely low learning curve for administrators, developers and IT managers.” - [<a href="https://www.ansible.com/use-cases/configuration-management">link</a>]</li>
<li>ISLE Project facilitating creation and management of Islandora 8 Infrastructure with Docker (containerized server). This is bleeding edge technology for deployment. This would require some infrastructure and training to prepare our staff for this option. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85332417-e999dd80-b4a5-11ea-9aa2-8d1a14f8655e.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="isle_prototype" /></figure><ul>
<li>Full deploy and integrate with continuous development on Github[<a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE">link</a>] <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/raw/master/docs/resources/demo3.gif" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Lazy Docker" /></figure></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The stack can also be a standard manual development and deployment. Although there is nothing technically wrong with this option, it is generally considered time comsuming to initially setup and generally considered realatively unnessisary. This has historically been Digital Initiative’s pattern of operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these options can utilize a continous development (automated deployment) life cycle. </p>
<h3 id="new-development-workflow-options">New Development Workflow Options</h3>
<p>Docker Compose and Docker Desktop combined allows developers to deploy applications on Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate. This new functionality streamlines the process of deploying and managing containers in AWS from a local development environment running Docker. This means the act of deploying changes to production can be dramatically sped up.</p>
<p>Previously, taking a local Compose file and running it on Amazon ECS posed a challenge because of constructs in Amazon ECS that were not part of the Compose specification, but were necessary for the application to run in AWS. For example, in order to run a simple Compose file and deploy to Amazon ECS, a developer would first need to leave the Docker experience and configure an Amazon VPC, Amazon ECS Cluster, and Amazon ECS Task Definition to name just a few of the AWS resources needed. As part of the collaboration, developers can continue to leverage tools like the Docker CLI and Docker Compose without needing to setup those resources in AWS outside of the Docker experience because it is now handled natively. By creating and switching to a new context in Docker, a developer can simply issue an up command via Docker Compose, which will create those resources automatically in AWS. This provides an easy path for developers to deploy and run highly secure and scalable production applications in Amazon ECS.</p>
<p>While the new process is fully documented on the Docker blog and the GitHub repository, let’s explore the beta experience where we show a simple frontend web application using NGINX talking to a backend written in Go defined in our docker-compose.yaml file. In the beta, users will notice an additional ecs syntax in the docker commands. This is because we will leverage a plugin in the short term but for GA, the experience will be integrated with Docker Desktop and a developer can simply switch contexts to run their applications on Amazon ECS leveraging the Docker commands they are used to. As demonstrated below, the setup is straightforward where a user will define the AWS Profile, ECS cluster name, and the AWS Region where you want to deploy your applications. By simply issuing a docker ecs compose up, the application and the resources needed for it to run will be created in AWS!</p>

You can login to the Matomo server using username <code>admin</code> and password <code>islandora</code> (by default). For more information see <a href="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/usage-stats/">Usage Stats</a>.The dashboard will look like this: <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/usage_stats_dashboard.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="usage stats dashboard" /></figure></li>
<li>Islandora 8 provides several different reports out-of-the-box. From microservice stats to usage stats. There are several options and are highly configurable. Here is an example of Mark Jordan’s module that provides a collection of graphical reports on various aspects of an Islandora repository. <a href="https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1381#issuecomment-636497419"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/403918/83357834-c30fd900-a323-11ea-8611-eeb1719c5a8c.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Page example" /></figure></a></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a report that can be done from either the object, collection, content type, etc.

4. “Supports logging of manual dashboard processes by authenticated users” <strong>I am uncertain as to what this is referring to at this time.</strong>
5. Like any other web servers, Islandora 8 can be hosted locally. The biggest benefits are leveraging the power of CPU multithreading and large memory size utilization are the most cost effective. However, self hosted hardware costs money to maintain and upgrade. Please see <a href="cloud-hosting-solution.html">Cloud Hosting</a> for other options.
6. Another option is using a cloud hosted provider like any one of the numerous options Amazon’s cloud hosting provides. Again please see <a href="cloud-hosting-solution.html">Cloud Hosting</a> for cloud options.
7. Another option to include is a decoupled headless version. This solution was recently demonstrated by Discovery Gardens. It allows for all of the management side of development to be done on the Drupal server but the frontend to be a Reactjs solution. This improves speed and allows a much more flexible frontend solution to be applied. This would allow us to develop the entire site’s frontend behavior to be implemented the same way we’ve created the digital collection’s landing page. 
8. The bare minimum to run Islandora 8 in a virtual machine (<strong>for development</strong>) is 1 CPU core with 8GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. A more comprehensive specification needs to consider applications in the stack with large needs for scalability. “Cantaloupe uses a thread-per-request model, and maintains its own thread pool to carry out certain tasks asynchronously and spread work across processors. Response times will benefit from multiple fast cores.” (Deployment, 2020) Blazegraph has a few complicated tradeoffs for RAM vs harddrive performance for ideal implementations. The configuration they suggest is a 4 core (3.5GHz) system with 16GB RAM on a pair of SSDs. For 1 billion RDF triple is 83.8GB of storage/32GB if in RAM (Bebee, 2020). In conclusion for the infrastructure, the system depends on the desired scalability and performance expected. This is a full content management system with several high performance applications. </p>

<li>Rightsstatements.org is not specifically discussed in the documentation. Although extensive URI integration for controlled access terms is documented on the site, an assessment by the metadata librarian would give a clearer picture. I brought this up to the community and they suggested this would be a simple module. There are a few options to achieve this but there is no “turnkey” module ready for this at this time.</li>
<li>Drupal is the gatekeeper for access management. Although Fedora offers WebAC access control as a solution to regulate access to Fedora resources, it was determined not to be granular enough for most of the Islandora community. WebAC only offers 4 types of access (read, write, append, and control) lack the granularity of group roles and conditional states. Drupal’s access management is far more rebust and is easier to configure. Restricting access by collection, object/node, datastreams, etc. is all managed within the Drupal UI and does not require any programming or aditional modules. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85619317-1974ec80-b630-11ea-9a56-191a20d721ab.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Permissions Screenshot" /></figure> <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue41/vanbergen/vanbergen_ill_3.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Conditional relationship and access action model" /></figure></li>

                <blockquote>
<p>This study set out to investigate the feasibility of hosting a digital repository system in a managed way in a private cloud environment. The system that was developed was functional, usable and had an acceptable level of system performance. Thus, a private cloud is indeed a feasible option for such software systems. Current interest in containerisation of software tools, through mechanisms such as Docker, are highly compatible with cloud management systems, as they each address a different aspect of the ease of management equation. - <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-34058-2_15">Investigating the Feasibility of Digital Repositories in Private Clouds</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although their findings were graded on user experience and less on the technical requirements it does show some promise for cloud hosting a repository. Currently there are a couple of Islandora 8 instances running in the cloud. After asking around in the community, there doesn’t seem to be any larger (more than 5TB) repositories currently running in the cloud. There are several pricing options within a cloud hosting provider. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>A few solutions are available for vendors to host a solution for a fee.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Able to run the stack on a cloud hosting provider like Amazon’s AWS. The demo is running on EC2 and Lightsail (an Amazon cloud solution).</p>
<ul>
<li>Price modeling on any AWS solution is complicated and varies greatly by size and frequency of use. The task of summarizing AWS option pricing could be its own project. “In 2020, AWS comprised more than 212 services including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things.” [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">link</a>]. </li>

<ol start="3">
<li><p>A few options specifically beneficial to cloud hosting include load balancing VM cluster servers (multiple identical servers) and a simple snapshot process for backing up. These can be achieved in hardware, they would require some expensive investments. Cloud hosting also makes hosting hardware unnecessary. An additional note is that some functions can be automated for either solution like scheduled backups, automated application deployment, and system monitoring. There is absolutely no mitigation of fully automated systems and application maintenance and most cloud solutions cost are prohibitively high when scaling to high numbers of CPU cores or large amounts of RAM.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A few vendors are available like Discovery Garden and Born Digital offering several options; anything from migration consultation, to migrating content from 7 to 8, develop a Islandora 8 solution that meets the institution’s needs, Islandora-as-a-service and several other options. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="other-hidden-costs">Other Hidden Costs</h3>
<p>Other potential “gotcha’s” that could be inflating your AWS bill include unused services started in AWS OpsWorks, unhealthy instances, and fees for excessive API calls. There are also numerous indirect costs associated with AWS and other cloud solutions in the form of performance, reliability, and cyber security problems. Misconfigured AWS servers were at fault for the recent data breaches at business associates of Verizon, the Republican National Committee, and private security firm TigerSwan. In February, numerous large websites were knocked offline due to an error by an employee at AWS, and the tech community recently expressed grave concerns about widespread chaos if AWS were to have another, larger failure, particularly since so many financial institutions rely on it. </p>
<h3 id="the-cloud-isnt-always-cheaper">The Cloud Isn’t Always Cheaper</h3>
<p>Despite sticker shock and concerns about these hidden and indirect costs, many organizations continue to grumble and pay their AWS bill due to the misconception that cloud computing is always cheaper and more efficient than purchasing their own IT infrastructure. This is a myth. In many cases, an organization’s monthly AWS bill alone costs more than an in-house solution would. If your organization processes large amounts of data, it would probably be more cost-effective to purchase and maintain your own infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs/">Amazon suggest</a> S3 Glacier is the ideal option if low storage cost is paramount, and you do not require millisecond access to your data. Glacier can retrieve data within 1 – 5 mins if it is expedited. Standard is available which takes 3 – 5 hours. Glacier comes with a 10GB retrieval free tier per month. Amazon suggest using S3 storage if you need low latency or frequent access to your data like accessing from an image viewer or web application. According to the <a href="https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">AWS S3 Calculator</a> the storage of 10TBs of data cost $2,700 a year not including accessing or modifying the data (those are additional costs). Discovery garden currently implements a combination of these to lower the cost but couldn’t say how much and what were the drawbacks.</p>
<p>It’s not always necessary or beneficial to abandon the cloud completely. Many organizations would greatly benefit from a hybrid approach, where they use their own infrastructure for certain tasks and utilize cloud solutions when they need additional capacity.</p>

<li>Oxford Common File Layout Specification (OCFL) is coming next year with the release of Fedora 6.x according to Danny Lamb and David Wilcox. This should be available within Islandora as part of upgrading Fedora to 6.x. <blockquote>
<p>The previously mentioned disadvantages of the Fedora API may be mitigated by a relatedcommunity initiative called the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL). The OCFL is acommunity-based effort to develop “an application-independent approach to the storage ofdigital information in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed topromote long-term object management best practices within digital repositories.” The originalidea for this effort came from a Fedora Camp hosted at the University of Oxford in September2017, so it has roots in the Fedora community even though the OCFL is not dependent onFedora in any way. However, if Fedora were to store repository resources as specified by theOCFL, major upgrades in the future may become much easier. One of the primary motivatinguse cases of the OCFL is to reduce the need for data migrations; both because moving largeamounts of data is time-consuming and because such migrations risk data corruption and loss.The OCFL decouples the structure of files on disk from the application(s) that manage the filesby defining a file and folder hierarchy to which applications must conform. Thus, the files can beleft in place and new software applications can implement the OCFL specification in order tomanage the files. - [<a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/download/attachments/131533003/Designing%20a%20Migration%20Path%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf">link</a>]</p>

Scan the website’s rendered content for images with missing or blank alt text attributes.

            <![CDATA[
                <p>In Islandora 8, metadata is stored in Drupal, in fields attached to entities (nodes or media). This allows us to interact with metadata (add, edit, remove, display, index in a search engine…) almost entirely using standard Drupal processes. If exporting this metadata to Fedora and/or a triplestore, the values are serialized to RDF using mappings that can be set for each bundle. Islandora 8 digital objects are comprised of Drupal nodes for descriptive metadata, Drupal media for technical metadata, and Drupal files for the binary objects. This section describes how Islandora 8 uses and extends Drupal fields to manage descriptive metadata. For more information on <a href="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/resource-nodes/">Islandora Documentation on resource nodes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="7x-migration-note-what-about-the-xml">7.x Migration Note: What about the XML?</h3>
<p>In 7.x, metadata were usually stored using an XML schema such as MODS or DC, as datastreams attached to an object. In Islandora 8, metadata is stored as fields. This means we are breaking out individual elements from a hierarchical structure to being individual independent values. Where some hierarchy or field grouping is necessary, this can be done in Drupal using Paragraphs, a widely-used Drupal contrib module. At the moment (Nov 2019) we are working on the technical challenge of mapping data from paragraphs into RDF in Fedora. The Metadata Interest Group has developed a default mapping (spreadsheet, guidance document) which provides a basic, yet customizable, transform between MODS metadata and Drupal fields in Islandora Defaults. It is suggested that individual institutions customize the mapping to meet their unique needs.</p>
<p>That said, if keeping the “legacy” XML metadata from 7.x is important to you, it can be attached to an Islandora 8 resource node as a Media entity. However, there is no mechanism in Islandora 8 for editing XML in a user-friendly way.</p>
<h3 id="content-types">Content Types</h3>
<p>In Drupal, Nodes come in different sub-types called Content Types (e.g. Article, Basic page, Repository item). Content types contain fields, and configurations for how those fields can be edited or displayed. Each content type is essentially a metadata profile that can be used for a piece of web content, or to describe a digital resource. For each field in a content type, an administrator can configure how data is entered, how it can be displayed, how many values can be stored, and how long the value can be. Some configurations, such as data entry and display, can be changed at any time. Others, such as how long a value can be or what options are available in a select list, cannot be changed once content has been created without first deleting all content of that type. However, fields can be added to existing content types with no consequence.</p>
<p>Not all content types in your Drupal site need be Islandora “resource nodes”. A “resource node” content type will likely have behaviours (such as syncing to Fedora or causing derivatives to be generated) associated with it. This configuration, and the communication to the user of which content types are and are not considered to be Islandora resource nodes is left to the discretion of the site manager. In Islandora, a “resource node” is usually considered a descriptive record for “a thing”, and is conceptually similar to an “Islandora Object” in 7.x, i.e. a “Fedora Object” in Fedora 3.x and below.</p>
<h3 id="vocabularies">Vocabularies</h3>
<p>In Drupal, Taxonomy Vocabularies (or simply Vocabularies) are also entity sub-types that define a set of fields and their configurations. Whereas instances of content types are called nodes, items in a vocabulary are called taxonomy terms (or simply terms). Traditionally, taxonomy terms are used to classify content in Drupal. For instance, the Article content type includes a field field_tags that can refer to terms in the Tags vocabulary.</p>
<p>Islandora (through the Islandora Core Feature) creates the ‘Islandora Models’ vocabulary which includes the terms ‘Audio’, ‘Binary’, ‘Collection’, ‘Digital Document’, ‘Image’, ‘Page’, ‘Paged Content’, ‘Publication Issue’, and ‘Video’. Islandora Defaults provides contexts that cause certain actions (e.g. derivatives to happen, or blocks to appear) based on which term is used.</p>
<p>The Controlled Access Terms module provides additional vocabularies: - Corporate Body - Country - Family - Form - Genre - Geographic Location - Language - Person - Resource Types - Subject</p>
<p>Each of these vocabularies has its own set of fields allowing repositories to further describe them. The Repository Item content type has fields that can reference terms in these vocabularies. See ‘Entity Reference fields’ in the ‘Field Types’ section below.</p>
<p>The vocabularies provided by default are a starting point, and a repository administrator can create whatever vocabularies are desired.</p>
<p>Vocabularies can also be used to display sets of content. When displaying nodes, both in teaser listings on the Drupal home pages and in full, single-node view, many Drupal themes display the categories applied to the node. If the user selects any category term, Drupal will then display a browsable listing for all nodes tagged with that term. To display content tagged with both terms or with either term is possible. Here are a few <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/organizing-content-with-taxonomies/using-taxonomy-urls-to-display-sets-of-content">examples</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">taxonomy/term/1

<h3 id="field-types">Field Types</h3>
<p>Fields are where Drupal entities store their data. There are different types of fields including boolean, datetime, entity reference, integer, string, text, and text_with_summary. These field types also have widgets (controlling how data is entered) and formatters (controlling how data is displayed). The Drupal 8 documentation on FieldTypes, FieldWidgets, and FieldFormatters includes a list of the core field types. Modules can provide their own field types, formatters, and widgets. The Controlled Access Terms module provides two additional types for use with Islandora: ETDF, and Typed Relation. These are described below.</p>
<p>Entity Reference fields are a special type of field built into Drupal that creates a relationship between two entities. The field’s configuration options include which kind of entities can be referenced. The ‘Repository Item’ content type, provided by islandora_defaults, includes several entity reference fields that reference vocabularies defined by the islandora and controlled_access_terms modules.</p>
<p>The ‘Member Of’ field is an entity reference field, defined by Islandora, which is the Islandora way of imposing a hierarchical order on resource nodes. This can be used to show membership in a collection, for pages that are members of a paged item, and for members of a complex object.</p>
<h3 id="edtf">EDTF</h3>
<p>The EDTF field type is for recording dates in Extended Date Time Format, which is a format based off of the hyphenated form of ISO 8601 (e.g. 1991-02-03 or 1991-02-03T10:00:00), but also allows expressions of different granularity and uncertainty. The Default EDTF widget has a validator that only allows strings that conform to the EDTF standard. The Default EDTF formatter allows these date string to be displayed in a variety of human readable ways, including big- or little-endian, and presenting months as numbers, abbreviations, or spelling month names out in full.</p>
<p>Example of the same EDTF dates displayed using little-endian format: 
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/metadata_edtf_display.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Example EDTF values" /></figure></p>
<h3 id="typed-relation">Typed Relation</h3>
<p>A Typed Relation field is an extension of Drupal’s Entity Reference field, which allows the user to qualify the relation. It was created for describing a resource’s contributors (modelled as taxonomy terms or some other Drupal entities) as well as their roles in this resource node (such as ‘author’, ‘illustrator’, or ‘architect’). With only Drupal’s Entity Reference fields, we would need individual fields for ‘author’, ‘illustrator’, ‘architect’, and any other roles that may need to be made available. Using a Typed Relation field, we can have one field for “Contributors” and let the user pick the role from a dropdown list.</p>
<h3 id="key-features">Key features</h3>
<ol>
<li>RDF Mapping; “In Islandora, the JSON-LD Module transforms nodes (or media, or taxonomy terms) into the RDF that is synced into Fedora and the Triplestore. It uses RDF mappings, a concept defined by the RDF Module, and exposes them through the REST API” (RDF Generation, n.d.).  <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85457087-a014c580-b56d-11ea-843d-780d6b13cd27.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Mapping" /></figure><ol start="2">
<li>“The RDF Module is part of Drupal Core, but has no official documentation. The RDF Module embeds RDFa, a form of linked data, within the Drupal-generated HTML when you load the web page for a node, media, or taxonomy term. Official line is that this will allow Google to provide “rich snippets” such as star-ratings, contact info, and business hours.” [<a href="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/islandora/rdf-mapping/">link</a>]</li>
<li>A custom module rdfui exists, and is installed-but-not-enabled on boxes provisioned by the islandora-playbook. We don’t use it because it is very rudimentary and limited to the schema.org vocabulary. </li>
<li>URI Mapping with persistent identifiers. With access to an API for minting persistent identifiers (e.g., DataCite, EZID, etc.).  <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers/raw/master/docs/images/mint_checkbox.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="mint persistent_identifiers" /></figure> [<a href="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers">link</a>]</li>
<li>The Dupal Schema.org Dataset module recently updated to extend the schema.org metatag module to support schema.org dataset spec. “DOI minting is part of UPEI’s publication workflow, where the system only registers the dataset with Datacite when a curator user ‘publishes’ the dataset, making it public. At that point it sends an XML version of the node fields content to Dataset’s API” [paraphrased from Alexander O’Neill from UPEI via slack chat] <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/04/23/digital-object-identifiers-stability-for-citations/"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogsmedia.lse.ac.uk/blogs.dir/9/files/2015/04/doi.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="DOI breakdown" /></figure></a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/schema_dataset">Schema.org Dataset</a> This module extends Schema.org Metatag module to display structured data representing datasets as JSON-LD in the head of web pages.</li>
<li>Migrating metadata (even complex metadata) is a simple process. In controlled_access_terms, we have an understanding of a typed_relation, which is an entity reference coupled with a MARC relator. The migration script expects an associative array that looks like this: <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85176275-7430d180-b247-11ea-9841-a5086a7ea3f7.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="associative_array" /></figure></li>
</ol>
<p>This is an example of the JSON output for an imported value. To see any entity’s json value add <code>_?_format=json_</code> at the end of the URL of the entity. <code>_jsonld_</code> will work as well to get the jsonld values as well. Example, <em><a href="http://localhost:8000/taxonomy/term/339?_format=json">http://localhost:8000/taxonomy/term/339?_format=json</a></em> 
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85176333-99bddb00-b247-11ea-8ac7-77573747ae3f.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="example_json" /></figure></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Although not absolutely essential it is my understanding that taxonomy vocabulary to categorized metadata should be migrated as entities first before the Islandora 7 objects and their metadata. Generating taxonomy from within a node’s migration is limited. For instance, a Subject’s authority has a title, associated authority and a URI. Automatically generating the subject from within the node migration limits to only the title. Whereas a separate migration allows for all 3 fields to be imported and referenced. Here is the list of taxonomy vocabulary list of “_categories_” of metadata.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Corporate Body,</strong> an organization or group of persons that is identified by a particular name</li>
<li><strong>Family,</strong> two or more who present themselves as a family</li>
<li><strong>Genre</strong>,  a category characterizing a particular style</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Location</strong>, Geographic area</li>
<li><strong>Islandora access</strong>, Terms used to limit, restrict or coordinate access</li>
<li><strong>Person</strong>, an individual of the human species.</li>
<li><strong>Subject</strong>, topics, events, people, and organizations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Attach attribution and license information to media images. If you want to add an image to an article that is licensed under a Creative Commons license, this module lets you add source, author and license terms links to a caption under the image, as per the guidelines published by Creative Commons here: Best practices for attribution.
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/project-images/Screen%20Shot%202019-01-16%20at%2012.03.18%20PM.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Screenshot of CC" /></figure> Another <a href="https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1234#issuecomment-654982007">solution suggested</a> To create a rights statement taxonomy from  <a href="https://rightsstatements.org">https://rightsstatements.org</a> and then create a formatter that use’s the term’s field_external_authority to create a link on the node’s page with a custom PHP script. This is fairly basic to accomplish the expected behaviors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="pulling-linked-data-authority-content-from-external-sources">Pulling Linked Data Authority Content from External sources</h3>
<p>Just like Samvera’s “Questioning Authority” scripts, Drupal provides several options for keeping its controlled vocabulary and authority terms in sync with 3rd party resources like the Library of Congress, Getty, GeoNames to name a few. Most of which is provided as a turnkey solution that requires not code development, dramatically speeding up development time.
The Library of Congress offer a Linked Data Service to pull content for offline use. Although a real time option is avaliable and shown in the <a href="/institutional-repository">IR section</a> of this report, pulling content at regular intervals is ideal. The full LC Subject Headings (LCSH) <a href="https://id.loc.gov/download">export</a> depending on which flavor is up to 430MB in size. A completely manageable size import/update and can be ran occassionally without impact performance. Treating this as a simple migration or cron job activity is fairly painless to setup and maintain. The process is no different than any other content import/migration. Starting with a basic migration template, the fields can be imported and updated easily just ike subject. For an example of migrating taxonomy terms with a CSV see <a href="https://github.com/DonRichards/migrate_islandora_csv/blob/dev/config/install/migrate_plus.migration.knoxgardens_subject.yml">migrate_islandora_csv / migrate_plus.migration.knoxgardens_subject.yml</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of authorities that are included for management in Islandora 8 include (but are not restricted to):</p>
<h4 id="people">People</h4>
<ul>
<li>Faculty members</li>
<li>Students</li>
<li>Alumni</li>
<li>Historical persons<h4 id="organizations">Organizations</h4>

</ul>
<p>To see more <a href="https://github.com/Islandora/controlled_access_terms">Islandora / Controlled Access Terms </a>, a Drupal 8 module creates vocabularies to represent common named entities in archival description (Corporate Bodies, Families, and Persons) as well as subject terms.</p>

                <h2 id="tl-dr">tl; dr</h2>
<p>Ingesting can be done in the UI but there are additional options for ingestion of content with complicated setups and complex metadata. Ingesting either by batch or UI offers a lot of flexability. There are a few ways to achieve an almost completely lossless migration. This may seem a bit misleading. Not all MODS/DC values can be identically represented in RDF form. In 7.x, metadata was usually stored using an XML schema such as MODS or DC, as datastreams attached to an object. In Islandora 8, metadata is stored as fields. This means we are breaking out individual elements from a hierarchical structure to being individual independent values allowing for a potentially lossless process data migration. Migrating URIs associated with a person, place, event, etc. is done by creating a taxonomy reference URI and asscoiating it with a relationship (for a person Drupal uses a MARC relator) to a node/object. URI graph support relationships in ways that wasn’t avialbe before. Automatically fetching content for DOIs or rights statements can be done. A few options are covered at <a href="/oai-pmh-and-doi-minting.html">OAI-PMH &amp; DOI Minting</a>. If keeping the “legacy” XML metadata from 7.x is important, it can be attached to an Islandora 8 resource node as a Media entity and treated in a simular way as a binary file in 7.x. Either way no metadata is lost. And the only obvious gotcha is there is no mechanism in place for migrating all previous versions of an object maintaining that history. There are custom methods that can be done to achieve this but a discussion needs to happen on weather this is worth the effort.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Migrate API is the main way to ingest batches of data into Drupal (and because Islandora 8 is Drupal, into Islandora). The Migrate module only provides the framework, it’s up to you to create the rules that take data from a source, through a process (i.e. a mapping) to a destination. A set of these rules is called a “migration”. It has to be set up (as a Configuration Entity, either by importing a YAML file or by installing a Feature) and then it has to be run.</p>
<p>Once a migration has been run, it will have created (or updated) a bunch of Drupal entities of one type - whether that’s taxonomy terms, nodes, files, etc. Since an Object in Islandora 8 is made up of several different Drupal entities that refer to each other, it’s going to take multiple migrations to create an Islandora object, and it’s important to perform these migrations in a sensible order.</p>
<p>A basic Islandora object is at minimum: - a file, which holds the actual binary contents of an item - a node, which holds the descriptive metadata for an item and makes it discoverable - a media, which holds technical metadata and references the file and the node, linking the two together.</p>
<p>A typical migration migrates files and CSV metadata into Islandora using only YAML files. This process transforms data with pipelines of processing plugins and can handle numeric, text, and entity reference fields. It can handle multiple values for fields, and even more complicated things like <code>typed_relation</code> fields. This description only scratches the surface of what can be done with the Migrate API.</p>
<p>There’s certainly more you can do with Drupal 8’s Migrate API. There’s a plethora of source and processing plugins out there that can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. XML and JSON are fair game. You can also request sources using HTTP, so you can always point it at an existing systems REST API and go from there. If you can’t make the Migrate API’s existing workflow make the necessary changes to your data, you can expand its capabilities by writing your own process plugins. Reading the Drupal.org documentation on the Migrate API would be a good place to start or ask the community if someone already has a solution for the challenge you’re facing. </p>
<h3 id="charter-questions">Charter questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Supports migration of objects and their associated datastreams from the Fedora 3 instance to Islandora 8. There are a couple of prebuilt solutions including a process that utilizes a Solr query and preconfigured mappings to achieve a full migration. Another technique utilizes the Drupal 8 module “Migrate Islandora CSV” (Lamb, 2019). As the title suggests this module utilizes a CSV file to migrate and can be generated via the Islandora 7x module “Islandora Get CSV” (Jordan, 2020).  </li>
<li>Islandora has a few options for migrating from Islandora 7. There are 2 core migration options that Islandora supports directly; Islandora CSV migration and the migrate 7x claw (a fedora to fedora option). Another option developed was the Islandora workbench.<ul>
<li>Islandora CSV is the preferred option for it’s simplicity. All of the migration processes in this option are both iterable and reversible. If changes need to be made to the object or it’s metadata the changes can be either updated or rolled back. This is an extremely important feature. This allows for the migration of collections of objects to be migrated with only minimal mappings (if needed). This means all RDF mapping doesn’t have to be complete to migrate the entire collection. RDF is not a flat MODS file that references some URIs. This is a problem with MODS. If a URI was to change, every MODS file must be updated to reflect the new destination. In RDF, the URI is stored and referenced as an entity and not statically in a metadata file. It’s ideal to separate out any value that will be an entity; a subject, person, place, corporation, event, etc. Regardless of the entity type the process of migration includes 3 basic steps; download the source, process it and then save it. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85171208-8d805080-b23c-11ea-8e7a-f5638be0ca3f.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="ETL Process" /></figure></li>
<li>Islandora’s <strong><a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/migrate_7x_claw">migrate_7x_claw</a></strong> module is a Drupal 8 Migrate Plus migration that  pulls content directly from an Islandora 7.x Solr/Fedora server. This module assumes all PIDs are indexed in Solr.<pre><code>       - Currently, the following content models can be migrated over with full functionality:
           * Collection
           * Basic Image
           * Large Image
           * Audio
           * Video
           * PDF
           * Binary</code></pre></li>
<li>Islandora 8 supports batch ingest of objects through the Islandora Workbench repository (Jordan, 2020). This app utilizes a CSV file to import the content (objects), the base fields, and can generate new taxonomy terms when configured to do so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supports ingesting objects via webforms. This is a basic fundamental functionality of Drupal 8 that Islandora leverages for all types of UI ingests and modification.</li>
<li>Supports uploading objects via a form and having that object approved and published by another user. This mediated process is done through a standard Drupal concept called an editorial workflow. This process is for an organization that utilizes several workflows such as create, edit, review, and publish and would like to restrict access to those workflows based on roles. A full breakdown of how this is accomplished can be located at Drupal’s Editorial Workflow page (Lakatos &amp; Hodgdon, 2019).</li>
<li>Supports self and mediated deposit. This process is identical to the previous comments on mediated workflows with the only difference being that for a self published deposit, the user should be granted the corresponding roles needed to accomplish the task. Please see <a href="step-by-step-setup-ir.html">Step by Step Setup of Islandora 8 Scholar</a> for more information on how to set it up. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85894536-eadb4b00-b7c2-11ea-86e5-fd7b0b825b59.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Islandora 8 Scholar Screenshots" /></figure></li>
<li>Supports uploading any binary file type. Islandora 8 treats all repository items as a binary content type. Binary files are treated the same as any other content type, a model tag is applied to an object/node indicating to Drupal which context(s) to use resulting in corresponding actions to be fired.</li>

The manner in which Islandora 8 processes all repository objects is similar to Islandora 7 ingesting a binary cmodel object with a Full MODS form. Examples of “compound” objects are objects from the Postcards from the Great Smoky Mountains &amp; Virginia P. Moore Scrap Book collections.</li>
<li>Supports the deposit and presentation of PDF objects. PDFs with written text can be utilized to provide searching capabilities on the content of a book or document. Ghostscript can be used on text based PDFs. Images require an OCR utility like Tesseract to extract text. This is built into the default Islandora configuration.</li>
<li>Supports the deposit and presentation of audio objects. Most of the functionality specific to audio is carried out by Drupal modules. Audio transcript editing/display, playback, and thumbnail generation of the audio’s waveform are all Drupal core and contributed features.</li>
<li>Supports the deposit and presentation of video objects. Most of the functionality specific to video is carried out by Drupal modules. Video transcript editing/display, thumbnail generation and playback are all Drupal core and contributed features. An Islandora 8 code submission is pending approval for transcripts (Manimjs_drupal, 2020) and an oral history step by step instruction as proof of concept is available (Shaw, 2019).</li>
<li>Supports the deposit and presentation of oral history objects. The only discernible difference between audio/video objects and oral history objects is the presence of transcripts. Transcripts are already part of the audio/video features indicating this is completely covered as well. </li>

                <p>A suite of microservices (Crayfish) are initiated during the process of ingesting an object, which maps resources to Fedora and generates derivative files among other things. Unlike previous versions of Islandora, version 8 asynchronously manages and queues these microservices for scalability, stability, and speed. Specifically some of these microservices generate derivatives like thumbnails, browser sized images, and OCR. The system defaults come with OpenSeadragon with an IIIF image server. The viewer can be switched to Mirador or Universal Viewer with a relatively small amount of code (Zoller, 2019).</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85142859-f5bc3b80-b216-11ea-970a-86c91f02a527.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="mirador_example" /></figure></p>
<ol>
<li>Supports the deposit and characterization of preservation-quality large image (TIFs &amp; JP2s). This process creates derivatives including but not limited to technical metadata generation and other access media for browser consumption.</li>
<li>Supports the deposit of books with preservation-quality large images as pages. Most objects in Islandora are treated like paged objects to begin with so there is little difference between a page versus a large image. The difference is the microservices that are triggered and how that changes the behavior of the viewer.</li>
<li>Automates the generation of access copies and other derivatives when an object is ingested and/or modified. This includes but is not limited to lower resolution media for browsers and thumbnail image generation for small &amp; large images, video and audio files (Waveform generation from original audio file for thumbnail generation).</li>
<li>Serves high quality access derivatives with image-zooming capability via a viewer (OpenSeaDragon, Mirador, or Universal Viewer). The default image viewer is Open Seadragon. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85144983-e8ed1700-b219-11ea-8cec-6558ff985901.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="seadragon-zoomed" /></figure></li>
<li>Renders images with a IIIF image server.</li>
<li>Automating the generation of the OCR microform is taken care of through Hypercube/Tesseract microservice. Tesseract is fully capable but it’s unclear how to configure Drupal to export hOCR. This may be user error and not a limitation of the stack.</li>
<li>Allows for bulk uploads from the admin console. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2018-10-16/Screenshot%20from%202018-10-16%2019-04-31.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="bulk uploader" /></figure></li>

<li>Islandora 8 is a “complete integration between Drupal resources and a datastore, to manage RDF conversion and asset storage” (Summary, n.d.). Islandora 8 can be configured to use a variety of datastores but it defaults to Duraspace’s Fedora 5.x Repository. Islandora 8.x-1.x makes use of the Portland Common Data Model (PCDM) as a layer of abstraction over LDPCs to make containment simpler to understand for users; a <em>pcdm:Collection</em> may contain other <em>pcdm:Collections</em> or <em>pcdm:Objects</em> (similar to an Islandora 7.x-1.x collection content model), and a <em>pcdm:Object</em> may contain other <em>pcdm:Objects</em> (similar to the way an Islandora 7.x-1.x compound object has child objects) or <em>pcdm:Files</em> (similar to the way Islandora 7.x-1.x objects have datastreams). (What’s the difference between Islandora 1.x and Islandora 8.x., n.d.). (See Figure 1 below.) See <a href="/pcdm">PCDM</a> for more information.</li>

<li>Islandora uses Blazegraph for querying its triple store. “Blazegraph DB is an ultra high-performance graph database supporting Blueprints and RDF/SPARQL APIs. It supports up to 50 Billion edges on a single node.” (Blazegraph, n.d.). “This replaces Mulgara. Formerly known as BigData. The intended use is solely for maintaining performant support of large Fedora repositories containing millions of objects.” (Replacing Mulgara with Blazegraph for High-Performance Low-Level Storage, n.d.).

<p>Islandora 8 supports nearly limitless use cases because of how the system is integrated to allow Drupal contributed modules to treat Fedora assets just like Drupal assets.

                <p>Islandora 8’s content modeling is based on ontology with a mix of Drupal’s microservices, context, and action solutions. Islandora objects are referred to as nodes. A node’s type is called a resource model. The resource models include (but are not limited to) audio, binary, collections, digital documents, images, pages, paged content, publication issue, and videos. In Islandora 7, content models refer to how derivatives are generated and how the object is displayed, however in Islandora 8 this concept doesn’t fit the behavior completely. When a model tag is applied to an object/node, this indicates to Drupal which context(s) to use resulting in corresponding actions to be fired. generating appropriate derivatives, resource mapping, and specifying an appropriate default viewer.</p>
<p>“Islandora 8 Data Model. Between the original capabilities of Drupal 8, the wealth of available modules, and the work that has already been done with Islandora 8, nearly any standard Islandora 7 content model can be represented in Islandora 8 from the simple (binary, PDF, image, audio, video) to the complex (compounds, books, newspapers). This is all done via the Repository Item content model which contains nearly all of the fields necessary to describe any type of object, and is the core of most of Islandora 8’s Drupal features. Many Drupal views and contexts can be triggered by targeting one or more of the fields in a Repository Item node in a way that makes requiring separate content types unnecessary. Examples include changing the template for displaying a node based on what “type” it is, or changing the viewer that is used based on the type of file a node has.” [<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Y7kGyVlrRW3uIqFPzMgQ2nj3gzB3U2FEO75X2n3bo8">link</a>] </p>
<ul>
<li>An object is a <em>node</em> (a.k.a. <em>content</em>).</li>
<li>Nodes have properties that can be configured called <em>fields</em>.</li>
<li>Fields for nodes are grouped together as <em>content types</em>.</li>
<li>Datastreams are <em>media</em>, which are <em>files</em> that can have their own fields and <em>media types</em>.</li>
<li>Metadata used to categorize entities are <em>taxonomy terms</em>, which also have their own fields and <em>vocabularies</em>. They can represent everything from simple labels to more complex concepts such as people, places, and subjects.</li>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Islandora 7 is a monolithic application that glues Drupal 6/7 to Fedora 3 with an optional institutional repository (IR) addon. Islandora 7 had several pain points, such as workflows, most of which required substantial coding to work around these issues. Although Islandora is  a collection of several Drupal 6/7 modules, it wasn’t written in a way that leveraged much of Drupal’s content management functionality. Fortunately the release of Drupal 8 has remedied this.</p>
<p>Future upgrades of Drupal versions will look substantially different than before. Gone are the days of major migration planning as Drupal has completely overhauled their application lifecycle. Drupal 9 was released in June 2020 the process of upgrading won’t cause any loss in functionality or any libraries to break; the core is completely backwards compatible. This important feature was adopted  for the new life cycle for all future version releases. It was explained simply by Alex Lopez, “You’ll just get notices advising you to upgrade libraries, function calls, and anything else in your code that would make your module incompatible with a Drupal 10 version. But, theoretically, nothing that would break your module/site.”(2018). A large focus of Drupal core and module development for the 8 release was on specific industries, including but not limited to big data and higher education. “Build a wide range of solutions from university websites, applications, scholarly publishing, and more.” (Drupal for education, 2020).</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85065822-db814f80-b17b-11ea-8eb5-4ee294bae8fb.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="background" /></figure></p>
<p>The Drupal 8 release in 2015 had a major overhaul of the code base. This meant that upgrading from Drupal 7 into Drupal 8 broke content libraries, functions, and theming. Drupal 8’s migration is an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process as part of its Migrate API. The data can come from a variety of places; a database, CSV, JSON, or REST function, and then transformed, imported, and processed (Migrate API overview, 2019).</p>
<p>Islandora changed the development approach to align with Drupal 8’s direction. A major focus on Islandora 8 is to build the stack in a way that fully utilizes Drupal 8 and make the contributed modules available. There are so many modules currently developed and actively managed by other institutions that provide content modeling  and developing metadata has become exceedingly easier. As the need for IRs increases, the number of options available have increased as well making it sometimes difficult to sift through to find the best option for the community. Since these modules are only a couple of years old, many of these lack sufficient documentation or guidance on how to best utilize the modules for a digital or institutional repository. The Islandora community makes every effort to bring content models together by research, community vetting, writing documentation, and creating solutions to help provide a ready made (turnkey) solution. </p>
<p>The benefits of using Islandora 8 (i.e. Drupal 8, Solr, and a self-described “bento box” of other technology) include continuing to leverage the Drupal expertise we have in it. Using Drupal 8 for UT Collections would beneficially build on that existing knowledge and infrastructure. Islandora 8 is more closely tied to Drupal 8 than Islandora 7 was to Drupal 7, especially in terms of managing collections and object storage. For example, metadata is no longer just an XML file in Fedora that gets indexed in Solr. With Islandora 8, metadata is actually stored and managed as fields in the Drupal database. The Introduction to Islandora 8 webinar notes that “metadata profiles are created via Drupal content types” and “it can be serialized into other formats (XML, JSON, JSON-LD) on demand”. Batch metadata updates are made possible through Drupal’s Views Bulk Operations by a “Modify Field Values” operation. Metadata display is configurable in the Drupal View associated with the object type. Islandora 8 promises to make good use of Drupal this time around.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/user-intro-bento.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="I8 Bento" /></figure></p>
<p>Islandora 8 community developers are also proposing interesting ways of integrating IIIF, such as <a href="https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1263">generating IIIF manifests from Drupal Views</a> results. The downside of continuing to use Drupal for Collections has a steep learning curve for collection owners in Islandora 8, since the level of configuration possibilities has increased dynamically compared to 7, upon first look. Continuing down the Drupal path means that the Collections service must continue to offer collection owners with sufficient Drupal 8 training and support. The question that hangs on Drupal 8 is: <em>will it complicate or simplify collection building for our development team and how long would it take to migrate?</em></p>
<p>Islandora 8 content is now utilizing Drupal nodes as the primary representation instead of how Islandora 7 overwrote Drupal routing to provide an object and it’s content. Islandora 8 content is Drupal content (stored in Fedora 5) and is completely compatible with 3rd party addons. In almost every cases the Islandora content is treated exactly the same as any other content imported into a base Drupal.</p>

                <p>This is an assessment of the current state of Islandora 8, communities involved in its development and maintainence as well as the avaliable features. This was written from a developer’s perspective with limited knowledge on metadata requirements. There are over 300 universities running <strong>Islandora 7</strong> according to the latest survey. As of this writing there are <a href="https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/wiki/Islandora-8-Pilot-Projects">four</a> instances of Islandora 8 digital repositories in production, one running an <a href="https://oaks.kent.edu">Institutional Repository</a> that was migrated from Bepress, one <a href="https://islandora-rdm.researchspaces.ca">Research Data Management platform</a>, and several not counted that are currently in beta. These numbers do not include government or private instances which commonly don’t report or aren’t publicly accessible like UTK’s <a href="https://trace.utk.edu">TRACE</a>. </p>
<p>Islandora 8 is build on Drupal. Drupal propularity has grown in the last fews years with <a href="/institutional-repository">higher education institutions</a> like Oxford University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Duke University, UCLA, University of Arizona, Penn State, Johns Hopkins University to name drop a few. As this assessment illustrates Islandora 8 is a full featured digital repository, it’s realatively simple to migrate content into it, migration of metadata is argueably lossless, it can be maintained by a fairly small development team, most actions require almost no coding making it highly sustainable to  future proofing upgrades and several large active communitees. Islandora is a mature platform with hundreds of professionals collaberating daily to develop a sustainable platform with the goal to allign repository content with generally accepted archive standards and meets the needs of hundreds of universities around the world. Islandora 8 uses Drupal so closely that almost any Drupal 8 module can be applied to any Islandora 8 content. This opens new options for the digital repository like using ultra high-performance graph database for highly complex relationship queries and machine learning technology for image identification and search results improvements.</p>
