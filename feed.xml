            <![CDATA[
                <p><a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF</a> (International Image Interoperability Framework) is a set of specifications that provides interoperability of image-based collections across platforms. What this means for a repository platform like Islandora at a general level is that image-based objects such as (still) images and paged content can be managed by Islandora but viewed in external applications, and that Islandora can bring in image-based content from elsewhere to supplement locally managed content. If this intrigues you, see the section “Looking under the hood (and beyond)” below.</p>
<p>At a practial level, because Islandora supports several of the IIIF specifications, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom, pan, and rotate images within OpenSeadragon</li>
<li>Islandora uses an IIIF-compliant image server (by default, <a href="https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/">Cantaloupe</a>) that utilizes the IIIF Image API. This capablity is similar to what Islandora 7.x users experience when they view a Large Image.</li>
<li>Display thumbnails for all pages of a book or newspaper issue within image viewers</li>
<li>IIIF-compliant image viewers such as OpenSeadragon or Mirador can display a “collection” of images such as all the pages of a book or newspaper issue using the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/">IIIF Presentation API</a>. For example, here is a screenshot of OpenSeadragon rendering all the pages of a book: <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://islandora.github.io/documentation/assets/osd_collection_mode.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="pages of a book" /></figure></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-iiif-in-islandora-8">Using IIIF in Islandora 8</h3>
<p>Implementation of the IIIF Presentation API is new in Islandora 8, and using it is as simple as configuring a Context (in fact, you don’t even need to configure it; the Context, Openseadragon Block, already exists by default). To use this Context, all that is required is for your book or newspaper (or other paged content) to be given a model of “Paged Content” or “Publication Issue”. Then, in the Openseadragon Block Context, make sure the term used in the “Node has term” condition (you can register more than one term there). Now, when you view a paged content Islandora object, you will see thumbnails of all of its child pages (assuming you have added some child pages to the object) in the OpenSeadragon viewer as illustrated above.</p>
<p>To view an object’s <strong>manifest</strong> navigate to the node’s URL and add <code>/manifest</code></p>
<p>Example: <code>http://myrepo.edu/node/23/manifest</code></p>
<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>
<p>IIIF-compliant viewers don’t need to be embedded in Islandora websites. If a viewer on another website knows the URL of a IIIF manifest like the ones that Islandora can produce, that viewer can display the content described in the manifest. Here’s an example of how a viewer can display from multiple external domains with just a manifest.

<li><a href="https://www.library.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a> Drupal 7.x &amp; 8.x</li>
</ol>
<p>With the release of Drupal 8 several universities, venders and volunteers have created and contributed to Drupal module solutions to meet acedemic needs. Here is a list of a few Institutional Repository (IR) &amp; Research Data Management (RDM) related modules currently available for Drupal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Scholar: Google Scholar(GS) provides a simple way to broadly search for scholarly literature. From one place, you can search across many disciplines and sources: articles, theses, books, abstracts and court opinions, from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities and other web sites. Google Scholar helps you find relevant work across the world of scholarly research. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/project-images/about_scholar.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="gs logo" /></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag">Metatag</a>: automatically provide structured metadata, aka “meta tags”, about a website.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/images/Meta%20tags%20%7C%20Drupal%207%20test%20site.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="metatag screenshot" /></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/seo_checklist">SEO Checklist</a> GS indexing crawlers rely on Googlebot to index a site. All of the typical Google crawler requirements need to be met for GS to index a site. That’s what makes a module like this critical.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/linked_data_field">Linked Data Lookup Field</a>: Supports Library of Congress Subject Headings, Global Research Identifier Database (GRID) entries, and CrossRef Funder identifiers and autocompletes the values out of the box. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/project-images/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-30%20at%202.22.31%20PM_0.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Linked Data Lookup Field screenshot" /></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers">Persistent Identifiers</a>: for minting and persisting persistent identifiers (Handles, DOIs, ARKs, etc.). <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers/raw/master/docs/images/mint_checkbox.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="mint screenshot" /></figure></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/orcid">ORCID</a>: ORCID integration and allowing users to login with ORCID credentials</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/user_progress">User Progress API</a>: The User progress API module was sponsored by the Pennsylvania State University. It has been developed for charting students’ progression throughout a system.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/workflows/overview">Drupal Workflows</a> is a core Drupal feature and is well documented. This was complicated in Drupal 7/Islandora 7 but now this process is trivial and is built into Drupal 8.</p>

<p>There are Institutional Repository (IR) &amp; Research Data Management (RDM) solutions in production. As of the writing of this there is 1 university running Islandora 8 as an IR in production, <a href="https://oaks.kent.edu">Kent State University</a> and 1 an Islandora 8 RDM portal at <a href="https://islandora-rdm.researchspaces.ca">UPEI</a></p>

<p>Thier listing of “format” is a bit misleading. All of the data was migrated from Bepress and alligned with thier format limitations. Several items are PDFs when a different format would be expected.</p>
<p>The company that migrated Kent State University Catalyst IT also has another Islandora 8 in production “<a href="https://canterburystories.nz">Christ Church City Libraries</a>“ and several more New Zealand sites in beta.</p>

<p>Develop features in Islandora 8 and integrations with other services that provides a comprehensive research data management platform that is informed by the <a href="https://islandora-rdm.researchspaces.ca/node/4">FAIR principles</a>. The project seeks to develop integrations with identifier, metadata, authentication, storage, and dissemination systems and services that support the research data lifecycle and FAIR principles - that is making research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The project is an out-of the box profile (with configurable but sensible defaults) for institutions wanting to curate and manage research data over its lifecycle.</p>

<p>This system created a Drupal content type that represents a research data management plan.  DMPRoadMap is software used by DMPTool in the US, DMPOnline in Europe. In Canada, the DMP Assistant in Canada is moving towards that framework. The draft Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy highlights the importance of DMPs as a best practices in research data management and this feature provides researchers with a tool to help them meet emerging funding requirements. This content type models a generic funder template and associated guidance modeled on the DMPRoadMap. It is possible to have Conditional fields to provide specific funder templates.</p>
<p>This module directly integrates ORCID oauth login relating their user profile with thier ORCID ID and giving them the ability to link thier submitted content with ORCID.

                <p>Drupal is a very popular and well-known CMS for educational websites. And it’s very important that Drupal has tools to deal with bibliography and citations. </p>
<h3 id="bibliography--citation-bibcite">Bibliography &amp; Citation (BibCite)</h3>
<p>The Bibliography &amp; Citation project (aka <strong><a href="https://www.drupal.org/case-study/bibliography-and-citation-module-for-drupal-8">BibCite</a></strong>) is a Drupal contributed module that helps to organize and save bibliographic data about the content ranging from web pages to books and scientific research works. The module gives a field to export a citation of sources according to thousands of standards that have been accepted at different times in different organizations. </p>
<p>BibCite provides an API for bibliographic citations rendering. CSL styles are used for rendering. It also provides the administration UI which allows to choose a processor (currently only citeproc PHP is available) and to choose global CSL style.</p>
<p>You can also manage CSL styles from the administration UI - you can edit or delete a predefined style or install a new style manually or from .csl or xml files.
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.drupal.org/files/image-1-admin.csl-styles.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="bibCite admin console" /></figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bibliography &amp; Citation</strong>: It is a core module that provides API for a render of bibliography citation. The library we used is from official CSL style repository with over 8000 styles. Those styles are available without charge under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (BY-SA) license.</li>
<li><strong>Entity</strong>: Implements storage for bibliography data as Drupal entities: bibliography, contributor and keyword. Bibliography entity can be rendered as citations, exported and imported.</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong>: Provides the possibility to export bibliography content. Adds export links to citations (configurable)</li>
<li><strong>Import</strong>: Provides import feature and UI for import from files.</li>
<li><strong>BibTeX</strong>: Provides possibility to use BibTeX format for import and export.</li>
<li><strong>Endnote</strong>: Provides possibility to use EndNote 7 XML, EndNote X3 XML and EndNote Tagged formats for import and export.</li>
<li><strong>Marc</strong>: Provides possibility to use MARC format for import and export.</li>
<li><strong>RIS</strong>: Provides possibility to use RIS format for import and export.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mjordan/persistent_identifiers">Persistent Identifiers</a>: Module for minting and persisting persistent identifiers (Handles, DOIs, ARKs, etc.). </p>
<pre><code class="language-text">  Persistent identifiers can be minted by a variety of sources, such as CrossRef, DataCite, or EZID. Regardless of the specific source, many of the tasks involved in assigning persistent identifiers to Drupal nodes are the same - providing a &quot;Mint Identifier&quot; button in a node edit form, integration into automated workflows, or persisting identifiers to fields on an entity.

  This module provides some common tasks while allowing small amounts of code (specifically Drupal services) to handle the particulars of minting and persisting. In addition, a Drupal site admin might want to mix and match minting and persisting services. Generally speaking, this module&#39;s goal is to allow site admins to select the minters and persisters they want, while helpin developers to write as little code as necessary to create new minter and persister services.</code></pre>

<li>In May 2020 the Islandora Foundation announced they joined the Drupal Association as part of their Supporting Partner Program. [<a href="https://islandora.ca/content/islandora-foundation-joins-drupal-association">link</a>] The Drupal Association is an educational non-profit organization that tasks itself with fostering and supporting the Drupal software project, the community and its growth.

<li>Islandora utilizes multiple technologies for community involvement including but not limited to<ol>
<li>Slack Chat</li>
<li>Zoom Chat</li>
<li>IRC (infrequently used)</li>
<li>Email/phone</li>
<li>Github issues/Pull requests</li>
<li>JIRA ticketing</li>
<li>Drupal Gitlabs</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Islandora has several Interest groups and collaboration groups that work regularly on community projects. A recent example of this was the survey and development of the Institutional repository Delta document. Although a IR repository is possible to assemble without a dedicated module it wouldn’t be a standardized process making community assistance a challenge. With help from the Google Scholar engineering team, the community developed with the help with feedback from the community drafted a document proposing an “Islandora Scholar” module that would bring together all the needed resources for a “turnkey” IR solution. Several options were left out deliberately that weren’t essential and could easily be accomplished with few steps from a tutorial. The Islandora interest group surveyed the community, reviewed existing IR options, and consulted with leading industry engineers. Creating a plan for a solution that meets the community’s needs and to precisely align the content in accordance with the Google Scholar engineering team’s feedback. Islandora has years of experience developing an institutional repository, originally developed in 2012 and the community is well equipped to handle the challenge of developing a solution that meets the community’s needs.</li>
<li>Vendors are constantly participating and contributing to the progression of the Islandora community and stack. They participate at a nearly daily occurance and provide a lot of assistance to community.</li>
<li>The onboarding process is well established with frequent workshops, video tutorials, 1-on-1 assistance from community members through zoom, and chat options. This makes the stack highly approachable to small colleges and large universities alike.</li>
<li>The Islandora community is a self-sustaining community of over 300 universities and an unknown number of private institutions, it’s clear that the community is well established.</li>
<li>With the platform mainly a “turnkey” repository option providing small and large repositories alike a relatively standardized solution with the flexibility of future growth built in.</li>
<li>The community has gravitated towards providing the options for the users to implement the latest information technology standards, iteratively improve the quality of the platform and inclusivity for the community to meet all of their needs for a repository. </li>
<li>The community engaged pedagogy embraces co-learning and is rooted in a respect for the prior knowledge and experiences that community partners bring to the conversation.</li>
<li>Expert discovery efforts (identifying improvements and developing solutions).</li>
<li>New efforts integrate the community into a broader community with Drupal. This means automated code review for security issues from Drupal, code hosting is hosted directly on Drupal’s gitlab servers. Having all of Islandora and its contrib modules on Drupal means the update feature in the UI will recognize the modules and allow for module conflict avoidence and update integrations.</li>

                <p>For self hosted soltutions there are 2 basic deployment options; Ansible(a style we’re currently using) or deploying through Docker images.</p>
<ol>
<li>Islandora’s <a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-playbook">Ansible playbook</a> comes with 2 preconfigured operating system defaults; Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS/7. The deployment can be configured for a local VM or a production deployment. “Ansible is the simplest solution for configuration management available. It’s designed to be minimal in nature, consistent, secure and highly reliable, with an extremely low learning curve for administrators, developers and IT managers.” - [<a href="https://www.ansible.com/use-cases/configuration-management">link</a>]</li>
<li>ISLE Project facilitating creation and management of Islandora 8 Infrastructure with Docker (containerized server). This is bleeding edge technology for deployment. This would require some infrastructure and training to prepare our staff for this option. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85332417-e999dd80-b4a5-11ea-9aa2-8d1a14f8655e.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="isle_prototype" /></figure><ul>
<li>Full deploy and integrate with continuous development on Github[<a href="https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE">link</a>] <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/raw/master/docs/resources/demo3.gif" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Lazy Docker" /></figure></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The stack can also be a standard manual development and deployment. Although there is nothing technically wrong with this option, it is generally considered time comsuming to initially setup and generally considered realatively unnessisary. This has historically been Digital Initiative’s pattern of operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these options can utilize a continous development (automated deployment) life cycle. </p>

<li>Drupal 8 completely supports CAS authentication [<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/cas">link</a>].</li>
<li>Islandora 8 provides several different reports out-of-the-box. From microservice stats to usage stats. There are several options and are highly configurable. Here is an example of Mark Jordan’s module that provides a collection of graphical reports on various aspects of an Islandora repository. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_repository_reports/raw/master/docs/images/random_pie.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="pie chart" /></figure> <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_repository_reports/raw/master/docs/images/random_bar.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="bar chart" /></figure></li>
<li>“Supports logging of manual dashboard processes by authenticated users” <strong>I am uncertain as to what this is referring to at this time.</strong></li>
<li>Like any other web servers, Islandora 8 can be hosted locally. The biggest benefits are leveraging the power of CPU multithreading and large memory size utilization are the most cost effective. However, self hosted hardware costs money to maintain and upgrade. Please see <a href="cloud-hosting-solution.html">Cloud Hosting</a> for other options.</li>
<li>Another option is using a cloud hosted provider like any one of the numerous options Amazon’s cloud hosting provides. Again please see <a href="cloud-hosting-solution.html">Cloud Hosting</a> for cloud options.</li>
<li>Another option to include is a decoupled headless version. This solution was recently demonstrated by Discovery Gardens. It allows for all of the management side of development to be done on the Drupal server but the frontend to be a Reactjs solution. This improves speed and allows a much more flexible frontend solution to be applied. This would allow us to develop the entire site’s frontend behavior to be implemented the same way we’ve created the digital collection’s landing page. </li>
<li>The bare minimum to run Islandora 8 in a virtual machine (for development) is 1 CPU core with 4GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. A more comprehensive specification needs to consider applications in the stack with large needs for scalability. “Cantaloupe uses a thread-per-request model, and maintains its own thread pool to carry out certain tasks asynchronously and spread work across processors. Response times will benefit from multiple fast cores.” (Deployment, 2020) Blazegraph has a few complicated tradeoffs for RAM vs harddrive performance for ideal implementations. The configuration they suggest is a 4 core (3.5GHz) system with 16GB RAM on a pair of SSDs. For 1 billion RDF triple is 83.8GB of storage/32GB if in RAM (Bebee, 2020). In conclusion for the infrastructure, the system depends on the desired scalability and performance expected. This is a full content management system with several high performance applications.</li>

<li>Rightsstatements.org is not specifically discussed in the documentation. Although extensive URI integration for controlled access terms is documented on the site, an assessment by the metadata librarian would give a clearer picture. I brought this up to the community and they suggested this would be a simple module. There are a few options to achieve this but there is no “turnkey” module ready for this at this time.</li>
<li>Drupal is the gatekeeper for access management. Although Fedora offers WebAC access control as a solution to regulate access to Fedora resources, it was determined not to be granular enough for most of the Islandora community. WebAC only offers 4 types of access (read, write, append, and control) lack the granularity of group roles and conditional states. Drupal’s access management is far more rebust and is easier to configure. Restricting access by collection, object/node, datastreams, etc. is all managed within the Drupal UI and does not require any programming or aditional modules. <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2738244/85619317-1974ec80-b630-11ea-9a56-191a20d721ab.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Permissions Screenshot" /></figure> <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue41/vanbergen/vanbergen_ill_3.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Conditional relationship and access action model" /></figure></li>

<li>A few solutions are available for vendors to host a solution for a fee.</li>
<li>Able to run the stack on a cloud hosting provider like Amazon’s AWS. The demo is running on EC2 and Lightsail (an Amazon cloud solution).<ol>
<li>Price modeling on any AWS solution is complicated and varies greatly by size and frequency of use. The task of summarizing AWS option pricing could be its own project. “In 2020, AWS comprised more than 212 services including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things.” [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">link</a>] </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A few options specifically beneficial to cloud hosting include load balancing VM cluster servers (multiple identical servers) and a simple snapshot process for backing up. These can be achieved in hardware, they would require some expensive investments. Cloud hosting also makes hosting hardware unnecessary. An additional note is that some functions can be automated for either solution like scheduled backups, automated application deployment, and system monitoring. There is absolutely no mitigation of fully automated systems and application maintenance and most cloud solutions cost are prohibitively high when scaling to high numbers of CPU cores or large amounts of RAM.</li>
<li>A few vendors are available like Discovery Garden and Born Digital offering several options; anything from migration consultation, to migrating content from 7 to 8, develop a Islandora 8 solution that meets the institution’s needs, Islandora-as-a-service and several other options. </li>

<li>Oxford Common File Layout Specification (OCFL) is coming next year with the release of Fedora 6.x according to Danny Lamb and David Wilcox. This should be available within Islandora as part of upgrading Fedora to 6.x. <blockquote>
<p>The previously mentioned disadvantages of the Fedora API may be mitigated by a relatedcommunity initiative called the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL). The OCFL is acommunity-based effort to develop “an application-independent approach to the storage ofdigital information in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed topromote long-term object management best practices within digital repositories.” The originalidea for this effort came from a Fedora Camp hosted at the University of Oxford in September2017, so it has roots in the Fedora community even though the OCFL is not dependent onFedora in any way. However, if Fedora were to store repository resources as specified by theOCFL, major upgrades in the future may become much easier. One of the primary motivatinguse cases of the OCFL is to reduce the need for data migrations; both because moving largeamounts of data is time-consuming and because such migrations risk data corruption and loss.The OCFL decouples the structure of files on disk from the application(s) that manage the filesby defining a file and folder hierarchy to which applications must conform. Thus, the files can beleft in place and new software applications can implement the OCFL specification in order tomanage the files. - [<a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/download/attachments/131533003/Designing%20a%20Migration%20Path%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf">link</a>]</p>
